[HEADLINE] :  nascar denies hendrick appeal
[TEXT]
martinsville,  va. (ap) -- the national stock car racing
commission  said friday that it has denied hendrick motorsports'
appeal  of penalties levied after jeff gordon won the chevrolet 400.
in  postrace inspections, gordon's car was found to have an
unapproved  intake manifold. the finding did not cost gordon the
victory  in the sept. 9 race in richmond, but his team was stripped
of  100 owner and driver points and fined $25,000.
during  the appeal, hendrick officials argued the magnesium
manifold  was supplied by general motors and presumed approved by
team  officials. the team also argued that nascar rules do not
specify  the material a manifold should be made from and said the
penalties  were unfair.
in  its ruling, the commission agreed that the winston cup rule
book  does not specify the material to be used in making a manifold,
but  said all parties acknowledged during the proceedings that the
approved  intake manifold, as listed in the rule book, is to be made
of  aluminum.
''regardless  of the source of an unapproved part on a race car,
the  race team that officially enters the car in a nascar race and
competes  with that race car is ultimately accountable for that race
car's  conformance, or non-conformance, to the rules,'' the ruling
said.
 gordon,  who qualified fifth friday for sunday's napa 500 at
martinsville  speedway, said the team was disappointed, but moving
on.
 ''we  felt like we had to appeal,'' he said. ''we felt like we
had  a reason to, but the decision has been made. it's done with.''
gordon  and team owner rick hendrick also noted that the part did
not  give gordon a competitive edge in his third victory of the
season,  and hendrick said he is considering taking the appeal one
step  further.
the  commission's ruling was unanimous.

leontien  zijlaard of netherlands took her third cycling gold
medal  in winning the women's time trial. she also won road race and
3,000-meter  individual pursuit, where she set a world record, and
took  silver in the points race.
birgit  fischer became the greatest medal-winner in olympic kayak
history,  leading germany to victory in the women's four for the
sixth  gold medal of her career and ninth medal overall.
mark  reynolds of san diego won his second gold medal by
capturing  the star class with magnus liljedahl of miami. it was the
first  u.s. sailing gold medal since he won the star gold at
barcelona  in 1992.
friday:
 eight  years after winning the long jump in barcelona, germany's
heike  drechsler won it again, foiling marion jones' quest for five
gold  medals in the process.
kenya's  noah ngeny beat favorite hicham el guerrouj of morocco
in  the men's 1,500 meters, the first loss for el guerrouj since
1997.
 maybe  four?:
after  gaining only bronze in the long jump friday, marion jones
looks  for another two by running in both of the women's relays on
the  final day of track at the olympics.
medals:
 there  will be 41 gold medals awarded saturday.
weather:
 warm  and humid saturday with temperatures in the high 70s and
rising  into the 80s.
cycling  silver:
mari  holden of colorado springs, colo., won the silver medal in
the  women's cycling time trial, after being passed over for a spot
on  the atlanta olympic team.
overachievers:
 the  u.s. women's volleyball team lost the bronze medal game to
brazil,  25-18, 25-22, 25-21, although it surpassed expectations.
indomitable  lions
cameroon  surprised spain in the men's soccer final, winning in a
penalty  shootout after the teams were tied 2-2 at the end of
regulation  and extra time.
more  drugs
russian  400-meter runner svetlana pospelova tested positive for
drugs  in an out-of-competition test. pospelova, the european indoor
champion  in february, was found to have the banned steroid
stanozolol  in her system. stanozolol was the drug that disqualified
canada's  ben johnson at the 1988 olympics in seoul.
close  call:
the  american men's basketball team survived a scare friday night
from  lithuania, 85-83, only by sarunas jasikevicius missing a
three-point  attempt as time ran out. it was the closest game for
the  united states since it started stocking its olympic team with
nba  players in 1992.
speaking:
 ''the  dream for five is not alive any more. i don't regret at
all  saying i was going to go for five. i had a shot, and it just
didn't  pan out.'' -- marion jones.

[HEADLINE] :  finance task force has closed hearing with lawyer for accused swindler
[TEXT]
newark,  n.j. (ap) - a french citizen accused of laundering $5.3
million  he and others allegedly made in a stock swindle has become
involved  in a justice department investigation of campaign funding
abuses.
 they  had a hearing before a federal judge that was closed at the
request  of the suspect, philippe v. hababou, according to court
papers.  it could not immediately be determined if prosecutors with
the  campaign financing task force joined in the motion.
the  nature of thursday's proceeding was not disclosed, and u.s.
district  judge william g. bassler sealed the transcript.
prosecutors  and hababou lawyer kevin h. marino did not
immediately  return messages left friday regarding the hearing.
justice  department spokesman myron marlin said, ''if hearings
are  sealed, we can't discuss them.''
of  the 25 people prosecuted by the task force, seven have
pleaded  guilty in connection with fund-raising during the 1996
campaign  of sen. robert torricelli, d-n.j.
among  them is cresskill commodities broker david chang, who has
been  cooperating with investigators since he admitted in june that
he  funneled $53,700 in illegal contributions to torricelli's
campaign.
 torricelli  has not been charged with any wrongdoing and has said
he  had no knowledge of illegal donations.
he  had been a congressman representing bergen county before
raising  $9.2 million to defeat u.s. rep. richard a. zimmer. his
fund-raising  ability helped him gain appointment as chairman of the
democratic  senatorial campaign committee.
torricelli  spokesman richard mcgrath said the senator did not
know  hababou.
campaign  records show that hababou mailed a $2,000 donation in
1996  that was returned three days later, mcgrath said. the records
do  not indicate why it was returned, he said.
a  possible reason: foreigners are not permitted to contribute to
federal  campaigns.
the  two-hour hearing was reported in friday's editions of the
record  of hackensack, whose reporter entered the courtroom and was
told  by bassler there was a compelling governmental interest in
closing  the proceeding.
among  those in court were robert j. conrad jr., the task force
chief,  the newspaper reported.
hababou,  45, was living in new york when he was arrested by u.s.
marshals  at trump taj mahal casino resort in atlantic city in
december  1998 on a fugitive warrant issued by his homeland in
february  1996. the u.s. customs service later said the arrest also
stemmed  from an investigation with the fbi into currency
transactions  at casinos that began in 1996.
hababou  was held without bail due to risk of flight. born in
french  tunisia, he holds french and israeli citizenship, is married
to  a swiss woman, and one of their two children has swiss
citizenship,  according to court papers.
a  23-count indictment handed up by a federal grand jury in
newark  in june 1999 charged that he and unnamed others profited by
selling  stock in which they held a hidden interest and whose value
they  inflated.
his  trial was to begin sept. 12 before bassler but did not take
place,  said the prosecutor handling the case, assistant u.s.
attorney  jayne k. blumberg.
citing  the sealing order, blumberg declined to comment further.

[HEADLINE] :  fbi focus on bush employee
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- despite her denials, an employee of george w.
bush's  media consultant remains the focus of an fbi investigation
into  how a videotape of his debate preparations were sent to an al
gore  confidant, a federal law enforcement official said friday.
the  fbi was comparing yvette lozano's fingerprints with those
found  on the inside and outside of the package mailed from austin,
texas,  to washington, the official said, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
 forensic  evidence developed by the fbi links lozano to the
package,  the washington post reported in saturday editions, citing
unnamed  sources.
the  label on the express mail package received by gore adviser
tom  downey on sept. 13 also corresponds to the date and time lozano
was  filmed by a security camera mailing a package in the austin
post  office, the newspaper reported. downey turned the package over
to  the fbi.
lozano  has denied mailing the debate materials. she and her
boss,  bush media consultant mark mckinnon, have said the package
she  mailed sept. 11 contained gap pants that she was returning to
the  company for exchange.
bush  spokesman dan bartlett said late friday that the fbi has
given  the campaign no indication of forensic evidence linking
lozano  to the package. ''we have every reason to believe that what
ms.  lozano stated are the facts,'' bartlett said.
one  federal investigator cautioned that fingerprints found on
the  package would not necessarily be conclusive since lozano may
have  touched items in the normal course of business at the ad
office  and had nothing to do with sending the debate videotape and
other  documents.
on  thursday, lozano told abc news that fbi agents earlier that
day  had taken a second set of fingerprints from her and had seized
her  computer.
fbi  and justice department's criminal division's public
integrity  section are trying to decide whether the facts they have
amount  to a violation of federal law. the most likely statute,
officials  said, would be one that makes it a crime to steal
something  from a federally funded activity. the bush campaign has
accepted  federal funding. but it isn't a federal crime unless the
item  stolen is worth more than $5,000.
lozano  could be prosecuted for false statements to an fbi agent
if  the government decides or is prepared to show that her denials
were  false.
mckinnon's  firm has been at the center of speculation in part
because  of his prior work for democrats. the master copy of the
bush  debate practice videotape was kept at his offices, as well as
a  briefing book, the contents of which were copied and sent to
downey  with the tape.

environment.  the republican presidential candidate, speaking at a factory in
saginaw,  mich., said today he supports opening 1.5 million acres of the refuge

[HEADLINE] :  report: dead student struck in head
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- a leader of a gay campus group at the nation's
only  liberal arts university for the deaf was found dead in his
dormitory  room after being struck in the head repeatedly, police
said  friday.
eric  franklin plunkett, 19, of burnsville, minn., who was deaf
and  had cerebral palsy, was found in his room at gallaudet
university  on thursday night after a student asked an official to
check  on him, police cmdr. jennifer greene said. plunkett had not
been  seen for more than a day, greene said.
the  medical examiner's office ruled plunkett's death a homicide.
although  police said they had no motive or suspects, they said an
item  was found that may have been the weapon. investigators would
not  say what the item was, or whether there were signs of forced
entry  into plunkett's room.
plunkett  was secretary of the lambda society of gallaudet
university,  a gay and lesbian organization comprised of about 20
students.
 police  have no evidence to suggest plunkett's death was a hate
crime,  greene said. sgt. joe gentile, a police spokesman, said he
had  no information that plunkett or any other students at gallaudet
had  been threatened.
gallaudet  university, which was established by congress in 1864
and  serves students who are deaf and hearing impaired, has a
student  body of about 2,000. school officials
''this  is one of the most welcoming places on the face of the
earth,''  said mercy coogan, a university spokeswoman.
plunkett  lived in a single room on the first floor of a
four-story  dormitory reserved for freshmen, coogan said. other
first-floor  students were moved to other floors thursday night, she
said.  the dorm is kept locked and entry is possible only with a key
pass.
 students  described plunkett as friendly, somewhat shy and handy
with  a computer.
''he  is a very sweet guy. he had high expectations for his
future,''  said jean frink, a freshman.
while  students at gallaudet consoled each other, staff
officials,  psychologists and social workers at plunkett's old high
school  in faribault, minn., met with the 160 students friday to
talk  about his death, the star tribune of minneapolis reported.
''i  just can't imagine him having an enemy in the world,'' linda
mitchell,  superintendent of the minnesota academy for the deaf,
told  the newspaper.
plunkett  graduated second in his class at minnesota state
academy.  mitchell said he had wanted to become a psychologist.

[HEADLINE] :  sydney games: greatest or grandest
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the sydney games aren't quite over, but
the  international olympic committee is already handing out praise.
a  day before the close of the games, ioc president juan antonio
samaranch  announced saturday he was awarding the olympic cup to the
people  of sydney for their efforts and hospitality.
''i  think i can be happy tomorrow. we will close a grand olympic
games,''  said the 80-year-old spaniard, who is officiating over his
last  olympics.
samaranch  uses the 1992 barcelona games as the benchmark for
olympic  supremacy, although ioc insiders are saying the ioc chief
may  have no choice but to bestow the honor of ''best games ever''
on  sydney 2000.
dick  pound, the ioc senior vice president, said he couldn't
speak  for samaranch, but he'd give it ''10 out of 10.''
''they've  been fabulous, everything we hoped for seven years ago
when  we said, 'low risk high reward in sydney as opposed to high
risk  and perhaps superlative reward in beijing.' what we hoped for
is  what we've got,'' pound said. ''i've always had very high
expectations  for australia. there was never a doubt that sydney
would  put on a superb games.''
sydney  beat beijing by two votes in ioc balloting for the 2000
games  in 1973.
ioc  director general francois carrard said the people and the
place  had contributed to the success.
''we  knew it was going to be the games for the sports-loving
people  and the athletes, and this has been brilliantly confirmed,''
he  said.
the  olympic cup, one of the ioc's highest honors, is given to a
person  or group for ''outstanding contribution'' to the olympics.
it  has gone to several other olympic host cities, although atlanta
was  bypassed for the cup after the 1996 games.
the  cup will be presented to sydney in a ceremony at a later
date.
 ''the  recipients are the people of sydney and new south wales
for  their wonderful spirit,'' carrard said. ''it's a symbolic
gesture.''
 at  a two-hour meeting of the ioc general assembly, samaranch
heaped  praise on sydney organizers, citing organization, transport,
enthusiastic  crowds and their example of fair play.
he  singled out the long jump final duel between australia's jai
taurima  and eventual champion ivan pedroso of cuba.
''before  jumping, the cuban, all the people in the stadium are
shouting  for him,'' he said. ''we have been very much impressed by
the  success of the games. they are wonderful games, with excellent
organization.''
 australian  prime minister john howard said the games would come
to  a successful conclusion.
''i  don't think anything has marred the olympics,'' howard said.
''they  have been well organized and i congratulate unreservedly the
people  responsible for organizing the games. ...
''i  think we've got the technological side of the games right
and  i think we've got the human side of the games right.''

[TEXT]
san  diego (ap) -- gary sheffield tied the dodgers franchise
record  with his 43rd homer and chan ho park struck out 13 and also
homered  in his first major league shutout, leading los angeles to a
3-0  win friday night over the san diego padres.
park  (18-10) pitched a two-hitter and extended his scoreless
streak  to 25 innings.
sheffield  hit a solo shot in the eighth to match duke snider's
mark  set with brooklyn in 1956. sheffield broke his career high of
42  with florida in 1996.
park  homered leading off the eighth to give the dodgers a 2-0
lead.  two batters later, sheffield connected off woody williams
(10-8).
 park's  drive gave the dodgers a franchise record of 209 home
runs  this season, besting the previous mark of 208 set by brooklyn
in  1953.
park  retired the final 13 batters. he has not allowed a run in
his  last three starts, having given up just 10 hits with 33
strikeouts.
 park,  who had already established a career high for wins,
allowed  singles to phil nevin and greg larocca. park walked one and
did  not permit a runner past first base.
williams  gave up three runs on six hits. williams lost to the
dodgers  and kevin brown in his last start when he allowed two
unearned  runs in eight innings.
tom  goodwin led off the game with a ground ball a few steps to
larocca's  left between first and second. larocca first bobbled the
ball,  then stumbled and fell as he attempted to pick it up for an
error.
 after  stealing second, goodwin scored on shawn green's two-out
single  to center.
notes:  sheffield came into the game with just two hits in 26
at-bats  against san diego this season. ... with his next rbi, green
will  join sheffield (108) and eric karros (106 rbi) as the only
trio  in los angeles history with 100 or more rbi in the same
season.  ... padres infielder damian jackson missed the game as his
wife,  tana, gave birth to a boy.

[HEADLINE] :  giants 4, diamondbacks 3
[TEXT]
phoenix  (ap) -- rich aurilia hit a tiebreaking homer and drove in
three  runs, and the san francisco giants clinched at least a tie
for  the best record in the major leagues by beating the arizona
diamondbacks  4-3 friday night.
the  win sent the giants (96-64) two games ahead of atlanta and
st.  louis in the race for home-field advantage in the nl playoffs.
the  giants' record also is two games better than chicago's in the
al  with two games remaining.
san  francisco has not had the best record in baseball since
1962.  the 1905, 1913 and 1924 giants also were the winningest team
in  those years.
livan  hernandez (17-11), who lost to brian anderson and the
diamondbacks  on sunday when he gave up a season-high eight runs,
allowed  two runs in eight innings for the win.
hernandez  pitched out of jams twice in his last three innings,
and  his only serious mistake was giving up a homer to matt williams
in  the fourth.
robb  nen pitched the ninth for his career-high 41st save, giving
up  a run on luis gonzalez's grounder. nen walked the first two
batters,  then converted his 28th straight save chance since july 2.
the  score was tied at 2 when jeff kent hit a leadoff triple in
the  giants sixth. after two outs, aurilia drove his 20th homer, the
best  of any nl shortstop, into the left-field grandstand off
anderson.
 anderson  (11-7), who went into the game tied with greg maddux
for  the best walks-to-innings ratio in the nl, issued a career-high
five  walks. he gave up seven hits and four runs in 6 2-3 innings.
marvin  bernard had an rbi single for the giants in the third,
making  anderson pay for a leadoff walk to bobby estalella.
san  francisco went up 2-1 in the fourth when j.t. snow singled
with  two out and scored on a double by aurilia. steve finley chased
aurilia's  drive to the warning track in center field and got his
glove  on it, but dropped the ball as he fell.
the  diamondbacks struck quickly in their half when williams, the
first  batter, homered into the swimming-pool pavilion in right
center.
 williams  walked and scored arizona's first run on an error by
kent,  who threw the ball low to first trying to complete a double
play  in the second inning.
notes:  arizona had runners on the corners in the sixth, but the
inning  ended when jay bell struck out and estalella threw out craig
counsell  trying to steal second. ... hernandez was hit by his
attempted  bunt in the third, becoming the diamondbacks'
franchise-record  1,199th strikeout victim of the season. ...
aurilia  and kent became the first middle-infield combination to
each  hit at least 20 home runs in back-to-back seasons. ...
hernandez  finished with 254, passing houston's jose lima (251) for
the  most in the league. ... hernandez is 6-2 in his last eight
starts.  ... the giants are 6-5 against arizona this year, 4-0 in
phoenix.  ... bell is 0-for-17 against hernandez in his career.

[HEADLINE] :  armstrong takes bronze in time trial
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- lance armstrong came to sydney
determined  to win a gold medal. he's going home with bronze.
the  two-time tour de france champion fattened his crowded trophy
cabinet  by finishing third in the 33-mile olympic time trial
saturday  (friday night edt), but it wasn't the goal he set for
himself  at the olympics.
viacheslav  ekimov of russia, who races with armstrong on the
u.s.  postal service trade team, won the gold medal with a time of
57  minutes, 40 seconds over the 33-mile course.
jan  ullrich of germany, who won the road race wednesday, took
the  silver, seven seconds behind ekimov. armstrong, wearing a
teardrop-shaped  helmet to reduce wind resistance, was 33 seconds
behind  ekimov.
armstrong  targeted the time trial as his event for sydney, a
decision  that took on greater importance when he broke a neck
vertebra  after colliding with a car while training in rural france
one  month ago.
after  he finished 13th in the road race, armstrong's last option
was  the time trial. the australian fans knew it too, and they gave
the  american a big cheer to send him onto the race course.
armstrong  and ekimov are close friends. last month, they warmed
up  for sydney by teaming up to win the grand prix eddy merckx time
trial.  that was two days before armstrong was injured in the car
collision.
 the  american seemed to take his cues saturday from ekimov,
coming  within one second of the fast splits established by the
russian.
 but  ullrich was there for each stroke of the pedals, and he
moved  into second place five seconds behind ekimov's time with one
lap  remaining. that dropped armstrong to third, eight seconds
behind  ekimov.
at  the final interval check with about six miles left, armstrong
was  in second, seven seconds behind ekimov. just over a minute
later,  ullrich crossed the checkpoint for a five-second lead over
ekimov.
 but  ullrich couldn't maintain the pace and he slipped to the
silver,  ensuring the bronze for armstrong. ekimov watched from the
pits,  smiling and accepting handshakes as his victory became
apparent.
 while  armstrong won't get the gold he wanted, at least he has a
medal.  after the road race, he was 0-for-4 in olympic events dating
back  to the 1992 barcelona games.
in  atlanta, armstrong was suffering from testicular cancer that
had  spread to his lungs and brain by the time it was detected two
months  later. he went through chemotherapy and surgery before
resuming  his racing career in 1998.
tyler  hamilton, another postal service team member who rode for
the  americans, finished 10th in 59:26.
ekimov  won the olympic pursuit gold medal for the soviet union
in  1988 at seoul and was one of the first from his nation to turn
pro  in 1991.
earlier  saturday (friday night edt), mari holden got the
americans  off to a great start by delivering a silver medal in the
women's  olympic time trial.
leontien  zijlaard of the netherlands won her third gold medal of
the  sydney games, covering the 18-mile women's course in 42 minutes
flat.
 holden,  of colorado springs, colo., finished in 42:36, powering
her  way through the two laps. mechanical problems and a crash had
eliminated  her from tuesday's road race.
''i  was definitely motivated today,'' holden said. ''i was just
hoping  for no flats.''
jeannie  longo-ciprelli of france won the bronze in 42:52. karen
kurreck  of los altos hills, calif., finished 16th in 44:33.
by  her split times, holden clearly was in the medal chase. but
since  she was the fourth of 12 riders in her flight, the only
question  was whether her fast times would withstand the challenge
of  later riders.
''in  my head, i thought i could win a medal,'' holden said.
''but  i think i was the only one to think that.''
it  was the second cycling medal for the united states, coming
after  marty nothstein's gold in match sprint.
holden  had the fastest midpoint interval of any rider except
zijlaard.  holden finished the first of two laps in 21:12 and the
time  held up until zijlaard came around in 20:46.
zijlaard  has dominated women's cycling in sydney. she won gold
medals  in the road race and 3,000-meter individual pursuit, where
she  set a world record, and took silver in the points race.

[HEADLINE] :  california tribe eyes casino
[TEXT]
torres-martinez  indian reservation, calif. (ap) -- for nearly a
century,  the murky, foul-smelling salton sea has blanketed about
half  of this remote reservation, rendering 11,800 acres unusable
for  the tribe's hundreds of members.
the  federal government awarded the land with the mistaken
assumption  that the water would recede. despite presidential
orders,  acts of congress and legal rulings, the tribe never gained
use  of the land or compensation for it.
now,  after decades of struggle, the tide could be turning for
the  impoverished torres-martinez desert cahuilla indians.
legislation  moving through congress would allow torres-martinez to
extend  its borders and claim choice real estate to build a casino.
the  measure, which cleared the house last week, would grant the
tribe  new land for a casino, raising concerns that a precedent
could  be set allowing other tribes to acquire choice
off-reservation  land and expand gambling nationwide.
''it  has already started a precedent. it clearly demonstrates
that  we have federal law that has run amok,'' said cheryl schmit,
co-director  of stand up for california, an activist group that
vainly  fought the legalization of indian gambling in california.
the  bill would allow the tribe to acquire a total of 11,800
acres  -- including 640 acres for a casino 12 miles north of the
existing  reservation -- and provide $14 million for the purchase.
the  bill resolves federal lawsuits brought in the 1980s and
1990s  by the u.s. government and the tribe against the water
districts  responsible for flooding the reservation and creating the
salton  sea, california's largest lake. although a tourist draw, the
381-square-mile  lake suffers periodic fish and bird kills.
the  legislation's sponsor, rep. mary bono, says that while
schmit  and others are justified in worrying about gambling
expansion,  those fears are misplaced in this case.
''it's  a land exchange for the land that sits beneath the salton
sea.  it gives them no right that they don't currently have,'' said
bono,  a republican.
john  tahsuda, general counsel for the national indian gaming
association,  said the tribe's acquisition is unlikely to set a
precedent.
 ''the  equities were so far out of whack on the tribe's side that
a  lot of people will see it as a necessary right to a wrong,'' he
said.
 the  640 acres that would be used for the tribe's casino sit at
interstate  10 near indio, about 130 miles east of los angeles. the
town  is also home to the cabazon band of mission indian's thriving
fantasy  springs casino -- a potential source of conflict.
nearby  is the booming tourist destination of palm springs, where
the  agua caliente band of cahuilla indians has one casino open and
another  one planned.
the  indio site is considered more favorable for a casino than
the  existing, isolated torres-martinez reservation, where only a
fraction  of the more than 600 tribal members live. modular homes
and  scrub brush dot the barren landscape, some homes have no
electricity  or running water, and remote dirt roads make getting to
work  difficult.
the  land deal has put torres-martinez at odds with the cabazon,
who  worked to defeat a similar bill in 1996 and agreed not to
oppose  the current measure only after it was amended to guarantee a
two-mile  buffer zone around the torres-martinez's casino land.
members  of the small, wealthy cabazon tribe admit they are
worried  about competition.
''what  we don't want is for them to be able to be in this
position,  which allows them to jump over all the cities and the
other  reservations in order to get into a better location,'' greg
cervantes,  cabazon's director of public affairs, said before the
amendment  was approved. ''that has not been allowed for other
tribes  in the united states.''
torres-martinez  leaders have decried cabazon's opposition.
tribal  chairwoman mary belardo said the cabazon have been led
astray  by non-indians who fill key positions in the tribe.
the  bill recently earned the backing of california's senior
senator,  democrat dianne feinstein. other tribes also have come to
torres-martinez's  support.
''this  is about justice for the torres-martinez people who lost
almost  half of their reservation to other interests and then to
farmers,  and decades going by and that not being addressed,'' said
mary  ann martin andreas, chairwoman of the morongo band of mission
indians.
 california  gov. gray davis has signed gambling compacts with 59
of  the state's 107 federally recognized tribes, although not all of
those  tribes have casinos. there are 41 tribal casinos in the state
and  many more planned.

[HEADLINE] :  rockies 4, braves 2
[TEXT]
atlanta  (ap) -- andy ashby had one bad inning and it cost the
atlanta  braves.
todd  hollandsworth and terry shumpert hit consecutive home runs
off  ashby in the fifth inning and the colorado rockies beat atlanta
4-2  friday night as the braves blew a chance to move up in the race
for  home-field advantage in the postseason.
''i  made a couple of mistakes. a changeup that i slowed down on
to  hollandsworth and a sinker that i tried to throw down and away
and  got it up in the zone to shumbert,'' ashby said.
''i  kept us close and felt good about giving us a chance to
win,''  he said. ''we're playing good, but some days you just don't
catch  the breaks.''
todd  helton added his 41st home run for the rockies in the
ninth.  the braves, losing their third in a row, haven't won since
clinching  the nl east title tuesday night with a 7-1 victory in new
york.
 the  braves are tied with st. louis for the second-best record in
the  nl. san francisco is two games ahead of both teams in the race
for  home-field advantage in the league playoffs.
''it's  important (home field), but i don't think it's something
everybody  is down about if we don't get it,'' said ashby. ''the
main  thing is we're in.''
manager  bobby cox echoed ashby.
''we'd  like to open at home if we can, but it's not the biggest
thing  in the world. we'll open tuesday, that's for sure,'' he said.
helton  said he doesn't get any pleasure in playing the spoiler
role.
 ''no  satisfaction whatever. we would like to be in their
shoes,''  he said.
what  colorado did get with the win is their 81st victory,
ensuring  a .500 season.
''it's  better than a losing season. it says to me that we're
going  in the right direction. it's a huge positive,'' said helton,
who  went 1-for-4 and continues to lead the league in hitting (.373)
and  rbis (143).
brian  bohanon (12-10) gave up five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings,  leaving after consecutive two-out doubles in the seventh
by  pinch-hitter bobby bonilla and rafael furcal got the braves
within  3-2.
bohanon  is 5-1 in his last seven starts and has won five in a
row  on the road. he matched his career high for wins, set last
season.
 jose  jimenez pitched the ninth for his 24th save.
ashby,  (12-13) who had won his last four starts, had only one
bad  inning -- the fifth.
the  right-hander gave up a leadoff single to todd walker and
hollandsworth  hit with his 19th homer, a two-run shot into the
right-field  stands. shumpert followed with his ninth homer, a drive
over  the left field wall.
ashby  gave up five hits and three runs in seven innings.
the  braves scored their first run in the opening inning when
furcal  led off with a single, took second when chipper jones was
hit  by a pitch and scored on a single by andres galarraga, giving
him  100 rbis.
notes:  galarraga became the third atlanta player to reach 100
rbis.  chipper jones has knocked in 109 runs and andruw jones 101.
...  in the second, rockies catcher brent mayne's throw attempting
to  get reggie sanders at third on an attempted double steal hit the
bat  of andruw jones. both runners were safe. jones walked, loading
the  bases, but chipper jones flied to center to end the two-out
threat.  ... if the giants and braves finish with the same record,
atlanta  would have the home-field advantage based on its 6-3 season
edge  on san francisco. if atlanta and st. louis are tied, the cards
get  home field because of their 4-3 season series lead. if all
three  teams are tied, the braves and cardinals would gain home
field  in the first round. the braves would play the giants and st.
louis  would meet the new york mets.

[HEADLINE] :  campus melees blamed on boredom
[TEXT]
boulder,  colo. (ap) -- they are rebels without a cause,
university  students who party 'til they riot.
they  aren't protesting politics or a football defeat. for the
most  part, they say the parties-turned-melees are symptoms of
boredom.
 since  the fall term started at the university of colorado,
raucous  off-campus parties have twice deteriorated into violence,
with  crowds starting fires and pelting police officers with bottles
and  rocks.
a  similar disturbance occurred aug. 26 at james madison
university  in virginia that resulted in 17 arrests.
some  students believe the riots are a symptom of boredom in
towns  that offer little to do. other blame a handful of
troublemakers.
 ''when  it comes down to it, the students don't have anything to
do  at night besides going to house parties,'' said colorado junior
josh  kahn, 20, a member of the pi kappa phi fraternity.
laura  clapper, 18, of greenwood, ind., was embarrassed by the
riots,  especially because members of her freshman class have borne
much  of the blame.
''i  can see why people would want to party hard but that's no
excuse  for a riot,'' she said. ''it's embarrassing for me and for
the  people who don't burn couches.''
she  has found plenty of fun activities on campus, but admitted
it  is difficult to provide entertainment for everyone, particularly
the  5,150-strong freshman class.
educators  blame a generation of students who have no little of
purpose  and lack political consciousness.
''what  drove them 30 years ago was really a protest movement,
much  more accompanied by drugs than you see now,'' said sheldon
steinbach,  general counsel for the washington-based american
council  on education. ''what may be driving this group of men and
women  may be this segment of that population have it too easy,
economically.
 ''schools  go to great lengths to try to provide a degree of
cultural  enhancement. to say one is bored, sounds like what you and
i  might have said to our parents when we were 14.''
at  the university of colorado, at least six riots have broken
out  since may 1997, when up to 700 people stormed the streets of
''the  hill,'' an older neighborhood with victorian-style homes
sandwiched  among stately fraternity and sorority houses. about
three  dozen people were arrested, including 23 students.
in  that disturbance, students were upset about a crackdown on
alcohol  use.
on  aug. 27, about 1,000 people burned doors, furniture and
carpets  in the same neighborhood. at least three people were
arrested.  a few days later, a second riot involved about 200
people.  five people were arrested, including four students.
in  virginia, police in riot gear used pepper spray and tear gas
to  disperse a rioting crowd of about 2,000 on aug. 26 at james
madison.
 james  madison spokesman fred hilton said the off-campus party is
held  nearly every year, but inexplicably turned violent this time.
stump  said campus riots seem to happening more frequently.
students  have rioted to protest noise ordinances, lost football
games  or university personnel decisions.
''there  seems to be more of an inclination by some to be more
confrontational,  to threaten the health and safety of others. i'm
not  sure what is happening in our society to make college students
go  in that direction,'' he said.
officials  at colorado and james madison have been searching for
solutions.
 hilton  said james madison has been re-examining its judicial
system  and code of conduct and hoped to offer more alcohol-free
weekend  activities.
in  boulder, officials have worked on building student-police
relationships,  holding students accountable for off-campus behavior
and  promoting more weekend activities.

[HEADLINE] :  u.s. campaign disrupts sudan bid
[TEXT]
united  nations (ap) -- the united states has jolted the annual
campaign  to fill five of the 15 u.n. security council seats,
pursuing  a late and intensive effort to remove sudan as the chosen
african  candidate and promote a rival instead.
sudan,  which is under u.n. sanctions, has denounced the u.s.
intervention.  other nations have questioned it. but the action has
forced  an unexpected vote for the african seat on oct. 10, when the
general  assembly selects five new countries to join its top
decision-making  council for two-year terms.
only  one of the seats will go to an african. the united states
is  now trying to help line up support behind mauritius -- even
though  sudan had won the support of most africans months ago and
been  considered the endorsed candidate, diplomats say.
sudan  has gone on the counteroffensive.
''a  superpower promoting a small country to contest another
country  against the will of the region is unprecedented,'' sudan's
u.n.  ambassador, elfatih mohamed ahmed erwa, said in an interview
friday.  ''the permanent members should not get involved in such
things.''
 erwa  said the u.s. campaign, which has been unusually public,
was  tied to election-year politics.
mauritius  had indicated it wanted the african seat back in
january,  and uganda has backed it. other support is uncertain, but
western  diplomats said mauritius has clearly been emboldened to
pursue  the underdog bid by the american intervention.
the  united states has made it clear that sudan, which it
considers  a sponsor of terrorism, doesn't deserve such
international  recognition that a council seat confers.
in  a memo issued ahead of an arab foreign ministers meeting last
week,  the united states asked for arab support in urging sudan to
postpone  its candidacy. sudan's presence on the council would make
it  harder to discuss lifting sanctions when the matter comes before
the  council in november, the americans argued.
the  council imposed limited diplomatic sanctions on sudan in
1996  to compel it to hand over the gunmen who tried to assassinate
egyptian  president hosni mubarak. sudan says various inquiries
didn't  find the suspects in the country.
several  countries have backed sudan's bid to lift the sanctions
--  something the united states opposes.
in  the memo, a copy of which was obtained by the associated
press,  the united states said: ''it would be highly prejudicial and
damaging  for the credibility of the u.n. if sudan joined the unsc
(security  council) when the body could be deliberating whether
sudan  has taken the anti-terrorism steps the unsc required.''
the  security council is made up of 15 members: permanent members
russia,  china, france, britain and the united states and 10
nonpermanent  members. every year, five of the temporary seats open
up  for two-year terms beginning jan. 1.
most  often, the candidates are selected by the various u.n.
regional  groups months before the actual general assembly vote.
this  year, for example, the latin american group has settled on
colombia  while the asian group has chosen singapore.
ireland,  italy and norway are contesting the two seats allotted
to  western european countries.
the  u.s. interference in the selection process of african
nations  has raised some eyebrows here -- even beyond the african and
arab  nations which typically resent u.s. influence in such matters.
one  security council diplomat, who asked not to be identified by
name  or nationality, said several countries would prefer that sudan
not  be on the council but that it was up to the africans to pick
their  candidate. ''you may not like it, but there are plenty of
things  we don't like that we have to live with,'' the diplomat
said.
 sudan  recently circulated a memo to all u.n. missions recalling
that  it had been endorsed as the candidate by african nations and
that  now ''another african country is being enticed by the u.s. to
challenge  the african consensus.''
''does  the u.s. speak on behalf of africa?'' reads the memo.
''does  the u.s. decide for africa? does the u.s. want to say that
africans  don't honor their commitments, or don't respect decisions
taken  by their own institutions at the highest levels?''
a  u.s. official said the united states was free to let it be
known  that it doesn't want sudan on the council.
''we're  not telling the africans who to pick,'' the official
said,  speaking on condition of anonymity. ''we're saying this
country  is not suitable.''

washington  (ap) -- a haggard richard m. nixon, his appearance
more  telling than his words as he debated a vigorous john f.
kennedy.
 jimmy  carter, trying to defend his failing grasp on the white
house  against the television skills of ronald reagan, the performer
who  became a president.
the  same reagan rambling on camera four years later, then
reversing  the question of his age -- 73 -- by quipping it away.
gerald  r. ford blundering an obvious foreign policy point, then
insisting  that his wrong answer was right.
george  bush glancing at his watch as though he just wanted the
campaign  debate to be over with, which, it turned out, is exactly
what  he wanted.
president  clinton, confident of re-election, commending bob dole
for  past service to the nation at the start of their 1996 debate.
no  need to take the offensive when he had the winning political
hand.
 when  vice president al gore and gov. george w. bush face each
other  for 90 televised minutes in boston on tuesday, it will be the
18th  time the democratic and republican presidential nominees have
met,  beginning with the kennedy-nixon debates of 1960.
gore  and bush debate again in winston-salem, n.c., on oct. 11,
and  in st. louis on oct. 17. the vice presidential nominees, dick
cheney  and sen. joseph lieberman, meet on oct. 5, in danville, ky.
over  all the years of debating -- there were none for three
campaigns  after 1960 because one party or the other had a nominee
determined  to avoid them -- the telling issues seldom have been the
ones  the campaigners planned.
instead,  matters of image and style, things that were not spoken
or  were said in error, have been the points that made points for
one  candidate or the other.
the  debates have delivered no major oratory, and no
breakthroughs  on campaign issues. in the age of poll-testing and
focus  groups, a debate before a television audience of 60 million
to  70 million is not a forum in which a candidate will risk new
proposals.
 on  occasion, a preview has helped score a debate point, as when
sen.  lloyd bentsen, the democratic vice presidential nominee,
snapped  at sen. dan quayle in 1988: ''you're no jack kennedy.''
quayle  had said, accurately, that he had served as many years in
congress  as kennedy when he ran for president. quayle had been
advised  against repeating it in the debate, but he walked into
bentsen's  line.
often,  the debates have reinforced impressions of candidates,
sometimes  to their detriment. that happened to ford in 1976 when he
declared  that ''there is no soviet domination of eastern europe''
and  wouldn't be while he was president, an error so obvious that
the  questioning reporter asked whether he'd really meant it.
ford  said the united states did not concede soviet dominance --
as  obvious as it was.
by  the time he corrected himself, the damage was done, and the
image  of a president prone to stumbles had been underscored.
the  1960 election, the closest popular count in american
history,  could have turned on the debates, especially the first
one.  nixon was vice president, better known than kennedy, confident
that  as the man who had debated nikita s. khrushchev in moscow, he
could  handle the massachusetts senator.
on  the issues there was no obvious advantage either way, in any
of  the four nixon-kennedy debates, still the most in any single
campaign.  but nixon was campaign weary, and ill, when he and
kennedy  first met in chicago, on sept. 26, 1960. he was wan and
sweating,  while kennedy looked fit and trim. nixon got a call from
his  mother, concerned about his health, after the debate. the
illness  was minor, the political setback major.
the  image problem afflicted democrat michael dukakis in 1988,
over  his bland, dispassionate restatement of his opposition to
capital  punishment in reply to an ambush question of whether he'd
still  oppose execution if his wife were raped and murdered.
it  fit the picture republicans were trying to draw of dukakis as
a  liberal technocrat, cold and emotionless. only the liberal part
was  so, but the debate episode seemed to go with the rest of it.
dukakis  said later it wouldn't have been so damaging had he been
running  a better campaign against george bush. then again, he added
wryly,  ''if i knew anything about presidential politics i'd be
talking  to you in a different capacity.''
in  1984, reagan's age became a morning-after question, not for
what  he said in his debate with democrat walter f. mondale but
because  he said it haltingly and defensively, in sentences that
wandered.
 he  blamed it on overtraining and overbriefing. and he got rid of
it  in a second debate by saying he would not make age an issue
despite  mondale's youth and inexperience.
reagan  wasn't supposed to falter in debate -- not the man with a
career  on camera before he became president. that points to another
factor  that has figured in debate ratings: expectations.
in  theory, the candidate who is supposed to be the lesser
debater  can win by managing not to lose much.
bush  and gore are working at positioning now.
''the  man is a great debater,'' bush says of gore at every
opportunity.
 but  the vice president says the conventional wisdom of the
expectations  game is not accurate. ''he really is a very good
debater,''  gore said, ''and he's won all of the debates that he's
ever  been in.''
bush's  father, the former president, has been in more national
campaign  debates than anybody else -- five presidential, one vice
presidential.
 bush  said in a pbs interview that he didn't like them, thought
them  contrived, too much show business.
and  about that glance at his watch in the 1992 debate:
''now  was i glad when the damn thing was over? yeah. and maybe
that's  why i was looking at it.''

[HEADLINE] :  cheney starts debate preparations
[TEXT]
jackson,  wyo. (ap) -- dick cheney tapped former aides from his
days  in congress and at the pentagon to coach, advise and critique
him  during intensive weekend preparations for his vice presidential
debate  thursday with democratic rival joseph lieberman.
accompanying  the republican nominee to his home in wyoming for
practice  sessions was dave gribben, a longtime friend. gribben
worked  for cheney when he was secretary of defense, was his chief
of  staff when cheney was in congress and now is head of government
relations  at halliburton, the dallas-based oil services company
that  cheney ran from 1995 until retiring in august.
also  on hand was jim steen, cheney's former legislative director
when  he was a house member during the 1980s and 1990s, and gus
puryear,  an attorney and former congressional staffer.
rep.  rob portman of ohio, who is playing lieberman in practice
sessions  for the danville, ky., debate was joining the candidate
saturday,  said cheney spokeswoman juleanna glover weiss.
cheney  will spend three days in wyoming and return to
campaigning  on tuesday.
aides  declined to discuss cheney's debate strategy or what
subjects  he may challenge lieberman on. but they said they expect
the  connecticut senator to go after cheney's conservative voting
record  during his service in the house in the 1970s and 1980s.
cheney  voted against funding for social service and
environmental  programs. he has said he did so because he felt the
deficit-ridden  government couldn't afford some programs and because
he  was supporting the positions taken by president reagan. he has
also  said he voted against some bills because democrats were trying
to  railroad them through a vote without allowing any discussion.
cheney,  in an online interview with abc news and the new york
times,  said voters are likely to place great importance on the
coming  campaign debates --three between the presidential candidates
and  his thursday with lieberman.
''most  of the advice i get is, be yourself,'' he said. ''you've
got  to come across as straight.''
cheney  got right to work as he ended a week of campaigning in
battleground  states, huddling with the three counselors during a
3&amp;frac12;-hour  flight from florida, where he had been campaigning.
the  advisers have been studying videotapes of lieberman
appearing  on talk shows and giving speeches on the senate floor.
they've  also immersed themselves in lieberman's legislative record
and  his position on the issues to prepare a debate strategy.
cheney's  staff has already made one videotape of a practice
session  and plan to make others this weekend to help fine-tune
cheney's  performance.

[HEADLINE] :  co. to buy back biotech corn crop
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- the government wants to make sure that a
variety  of gene-altered corn linked to a nationwide recall of taco
shells  doesn't get into the food supply again.
aventis  cropscience, the company that produces the corn seed,
agreed  friday to buy all of this year's crop, worth an estimated
$68  million.
federal  officials say there is no known health risk from the
corn,  known as starlink, but it has not been approved for human
consumption  because scientists are unsure whether it might cause
allergic  reactions.
the  recalled corn will eventually be sold for cattle feed or for
production  of ethanol, a gasoline additive. the agriculture
department  will purchase the grain from farmers and then oversee
its  shipping to buyers to ensure that it doesn't get mixed up with
food-grade  corn, usda officials said. aventis will reimburse the
government  for all its expenses, including shipping and storage
costs,  and in turn will get the proceeds from the corn's sale.
''this  action is a prudent and responsible step to prevent the
current  crop of starlink corn from being used in processed foods,''
usda  and the environmental protection agency said in a joint
statement.
 kraft  foods recalled millions of packages of taco shells sold in
stores  under the taco bell name after tests showed that some were
made  with the aventis variety. taco bell corp. said it was
replacing  all the shells in its restaurants.
epa  approved the crop for commercial use in 1998 with the
condition  that it only be used for animal feed. the starlink corn
contains  a bacterium gene that makes it toxic to insects.
it  is one of eight varieties of genetically engineered corn that
have  been approved by the government and the only one that is not
approved  for use in food.
''we  felt that it is vitally important for both our domestic and
import  customers to have aventis take this step of corporate good
faith  to intervene in the marketplace to make sure this 2000 crop
is  taken out of the stream,'' said bruce knight, vice president of
public  policy for the corn growers association.
about  300,000 acres of the corn were planted, 0.4 percent of the
total  u.s. corn acreage.

[HEADLINE] :  fujimori: peru will be stable
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- under fire at home, peruvian president alberto
fujimori  is getting support from the clinton administration and the
organization  of american states for his goal of a transition to new
leadership  next year under a strengthened democratic process.
it  was just two months ago that fujimori was sworn in to a third
term,  but a corruption scandal and other developments have left him
in  a weakened position, forcing him to call elections four years
ahead  of schedule.
''you've  done the right thing,'' secretary of state madeleine
albright  told fujimori on friday, according to state department
spokesman  richard boucher.
boucher  said she also urged fujimori to promote reforms that
will  end abuses that have marked past election campaigns.
as  fujimori made his rounds here on his hastily arranged visit,
the  peruvian congress voted to dismantle the country's national
intelligence  service, which for a decade served as the power base
of  discredited and now-exiled spy chief vladimiro montesinos. the
vote  was 101-1.
rumors  of a military coup plot have swirled around lima in
recent  days. in addition, fujimori has faced demands for his
resignation  from political opponents and for the extradition of
montesinos,  who was forced into exile in panama last sunday. he is
accused  of trying to bribe an opposition congressman to join
fujimori's  alliance.
fujimori  said friday he was confident he will be able to ride
out  the storm. ''stability and democracy will be guaranteed,'' he
said.
 fujimori's  visit here also included a meeting thursday evening
with  oas secretary general cesar gaviria, who is overseeing a
dialogue  among peruvian political leaders aimed at forging a
consensus  on ground rules for next year's elections.
at  a news conference friday, gaviria said the process is working
well,  noting that a series of agreements has been reached,
including  a commitment to announce an election date by oct. 15.
he  suggested the oas-led process is indispensable for democratic
stability  in peru, saying, ''there is no other way.''
gaviria  acknowledged there have been threats by some in the
military  to stage a coup but said he expects its support for the
process.
 ''the  most important thing is to protect and preserve peruvian
democracy,''  he said.
fujimori  also met with president clinton's national security
adviser,  sandy berger.
white  house spokesman joe lockhart said fujimori received a
consistent  message from albright and berger that he is pursuing the
right  path forward toward ''full democracy.''
''the  message that we heard was that he believed in the oas
process,  and we reiterated that we wanted to see this done as soon
as  possible,'' lockhart said.

[HEADLINE] :  n.korea threatens u.s. war remains
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- north korea is threatening to stop cooperating
with  u.s. efforts to recover remains of american servicemen lost in
the  korean war unless the pentagon provides more humanitarian aid.
in  talks sept. 15 in the north korean capital of pyongyang, a
north  korean army officer told robert jones, the pentagon official
in  charge of pow-mia issues, that a deal reached in june to provide
u.s.  access to battlefields will not be renewed when it expires in
november  unless the aid issue is settled first.
the  united states is paying north korea $2 million this year for
its  assistance in the remains recovery.
on  a more optimistic note for u.s.-north korea relations, the
state  department announced friday that president clinton will meet
next  month with cho myong nok, the first vice chairman of north
korea's  national defense commission. he will be the highest-ranking
north  korean official to visit washington.
cho  is considered second in command to the country's leader, kim
jong  il.
the  talks also have been centered on terms of an accord that
froze  north korea's nuclear weapons program in exchange for energy
supplies  and two civilian reactors, state department officials
said.
 north  korea's past involvement in terrorism is on the agenda as
well,  but state department spokesman richard boucher said that
issue  will be dealt with next week. he said the tone of the talks
after  three days ''remains positive.''
u.s.  forensics experts, working in an area about 60 miles north
of  pyongyang where hundreds of american servicemen were killed in
battles  with chinese troops in october 1950, have recovered 35 sets
of  remains this year. among them are nine sets of remains flown out
of  pyongyang on sept. 15 aboard a u.s. air force transport plane.
jones  accompanied the remains to hawaii for a repatriation
ceremony.
 during  a three-hour meeting in pyongyang, sr. col. pak rim su
told  jones ''there is a threat to this current cooperative
environment  and to future prospects'' for recovering u.s.
servicemen's  remains, jones wrote in a memo monday to walter
slocombe,  the under secretary of defense for policy.
''a  return to normal operations could only occur after the
united  states resolved the problem of 'anti-american sentiment'
among  the north korean populace,'' jones said pak told him. pak
said  the solution was for the pentagon to provide the kind of
humanitarian  assistance north korea asked for last december.
in  the december talks, the north koreans demanded that the
pentagon  pay for construction of a clothing factory large enough to
provide  shoes and clothing for all children in north korea. without
such  a goodwill gesture, they insisted, ordinary north koreans
would  resist cooperation on remains recovery.
jones  told pak that the clothing factory idea was unrealistic
and  that any requests for humanitarian assistance would have to be
presented  to the state department. in addition to the $2 million in
compensation  for remains recovery efforts, the united states has
given  north korean hundreds of millions of dollars in food aid in
recent  years, as well as fuel assistance as part of a nuclear
agreement.
 pak  told jones that the pentagon would have to respond on the
humanitarian  issue by october. otherwise, talks planned for
december  to agree on arrangements for remains recovery operations
in  2001 will not be successful, pak said.
of  the approximately 8,100 u.s. servicemen listed as unaccounted
for  from the 1950-53 korean war, the pentagon believes that remains
of  as many as 1,500 may be recoverable from the area that u.s.
forensics  experts have been working this year. their final
scheduled  mission of the year is due to end nov. 11.
jones  also held talks with chinese officials in beijing this
month  on issues related to accounting for u.s. servicemen. a
ministry  of foreign affairs official disclosed to jones that crash
sites  believed to contain the wreckage of two american aircraft
from  the world war ii period had been discovered in tibet.
no  other information about the planes was provided.

[HEADLINE] :  smithsonian: bananas changed u.s.
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- americans went bananas a century ago and the
tropical  fruit has been as american as apple pie ever since. so
american,  in fact, that the venerable smithsonian institution has
published  a 210-page book telling the story of the banana's role in
u.s.  history -- everything from banana splits to banana republics.
banana  lore goes back to the unconfirmed report that a shipment
reached  the stolid folks in salem, mass., in 1690. they tried
boiling  them with pork. it took nearly two centuries after that
culinary  disaster for bananas to catch on with north americans.
but  when they did in the late 19th century, bananas quickly
became  the nation's most popular fruit, a status they retain to
this  day. in 1998, americans ate an average of 28.58 pounds of
bananas,  compared with 19.2 pounds of fresh apples.
written  by virginia scott jenkins, ''bananas, an american
history,''  published by smithsonian university press, names 62
popular  songs about bananas, including rosemary clooney's ''a bunch
of  bananas,'' carmen miranda's ''i made my money with bananas'' and
the  1923 hit, ''yes! we have no bananas.''
but  probably the most famous banana tune was the jingle sung by
carmen  miranda that told americans to store the fruit at room
temperature,  ''never in the refrigerator.'' the jingle was popular
in  the post-world war ii era when many americans acquired their
first  refrigerator. jenkins records that on one day it played 376
times  on the radio.
people  slipping on banana peels remain a staple of jokes and
cartoons.  limericks became popular in the 19th century and one
published  in 1886 began this way:
''a  certain young woman named hannah
''slipped  down on a piece of banana;
''she  shrieked, and oh, my'd!
''and  more stars she spied
''than  belong to the star-spangled banner.''
the  first banana imports of any quantity came from cuba, brought
to  the united states by enterprising ship captains looking for
marketable  cargo on return voyages. a new york merchant imported
300  bunches of cuban reds in 1843 and sold them for 25 cents a
banana,  comparable to about $2 today.
in  the 1880s, lorenzo dow baker, a cape cod fishing boat
captain,  and andrew preston, a boston produce agent, joined forces
to  create the firm that became united fruit co. it became the
leader  in importing bananas and popularizing them.
jenkins  relates how united fruit and its competitors developed
plantations  throughout central america and wielded so much power in
several  small countries that they became known as banana republics.
bananas  remain a touchy foreign policy issue. the united states
is  imposing tariffs on european luxury goods in retaliation for
barriers  imposed by the european union on bananas from the central
american  plantations of u.s. companies.
banana  importers succeeded in promoting their product as one of
the  healthiest of foods. articles advised americans eat bananas raw
and  cooked, on cereal and in sandwiches.
''the  banana is also rich in mineral salts, containing as much
iron  as whole wheat bread and outranking the potato in
energy-giving  qualities,'' said an article in a 1981 issue of the
ladies  home journal.
the  smithsonian book records that a soda fountain in latrobe,
pa.,  created the first banana split in 1904. students at garringer
high  school in charlotte, n.c., in 1967 set the record for the
world's  largest banana split, a 250-foot creation that used 500
bananas,  45 gallons of ice cream and 12 gallons of toppings.
bananas  even played a role in cold war rhetoric. in fulton, ky.,
a  railroad crossroads through which bananas were shipped, the
international  banana festival was founded in the 1960s to celebrate
where  the mutual interests of north and south america coincided.
''the  theme, project-unite us, was conceived with the ultimate
goal  to 'fight communism with bananas,''' the fulton daily leader
reported.
 the  program for the sixth annual festival in 1968 described its
youth  program as ''a blow aimed at the beachhead which communism is
attempting  to establish in these banana-producing countries.''

[HEADLINE] :  potentially toxic artifacts found
[TEXT]
san  francisco (ap) -- david hostler learned the troubling news
when  he journeyed more than 3,000 miles from his hoopa valley
reservation,  california's largest, to dig through troves of tribal
artifacts  on display and in storage at harvard university.
arriving  at the ivy league school's peabody museum of
archaeology  and ethnology, which owns the largest collection of
american  indian remains outside the smithsonian, officials
suggested  he don a pair of gloves and a dust mask before sifting
through  the collection.
''that's  when i found out some of the artifacts had been
contaminated,''  said hostler, a director of the hoopa museum and a
ceremonial  leader of the tribe, which has 4,000 members and an
89,000-acre  reservation about 40 miles outside the northern
california  coastal city of eureka.
two  years later, hostler and fellow indians across the united
states  remain unsettled by the notion that human remains and sacred
objects  being returned to them under the native american graves
protection  and repatriation act, or nagpra, may be poisoned with
heavy  metals and pesticides that were used as preservatives.
on  friday, representatives of california's 110 tribes began
arriving  at san francisco state university for a three-day workshop
aimed  at raising awareness of the potential health risks that
scientists  consider especially acute because many of the artifacts
--  steeped in spiritual significance -- have been or will be returned
to  their traditional use.
''for  people who are only hearing about this for the first time,
it's  only human to be scared and angry,'' said lee davis, an
anthropology  professor at sfsu and consultant for the hoopa tribe.
pesticides  and other toxins, including mercury and arsenic, have
been  routinely used on all kinds of artifacts to preserve them and
keep  insects away, with the idea that the objects would only be
displayed  under glass.
but  that changed when the repatriation act, passed in 1990,
required  museums to return headdresses and other regalia to their
rightful  tribal owners.
it  is unclear how widespread the contamination may be, since
most  of the evidence is anecdotal and no official empirical studies
have  been conducted to determine whether mercury, arsenic, ddt and
other  toxins used as pesticides or preservatives persist in harmful
levels.
 sfsu  on friday released preliminary findings of a study showing
traces  of mercury in a handful of items that have found their way
back  to the hoopa tribe. there were also low levels of pesticides
on  some samples, including ddt and naphthalene, an active
ingredient  in mothballs.
but  peter palmer, a chemical analyst who led the study,
questioned  whether the results were reliable, saying he was ''not
sure  how they would hold up in a court of law.''
he  and other researchers noted how they are impeded by financial
constraints  and limited in the types of testing they can do since a
lot  of the cultural material must remain intact, and removing
toxins  could be destructive.
''there  are no easy answers -- a lot of uncertainties,'' palmer
told  a large group of other scientists, indian leaders and
observers  during one of friday's sessions, calling the study a
''best  effort'' by students. ''at least we've done this much.''
palmer  and other scientists agree more in-depth studies are
needed.  on sunday, organizers plan to start drawing up a cohesive
plan  to address the issues raised at the workshop.
''the  ramifications are complex,'' said jeff fentress,
coordinator  of sfsu's artifact testing lab. ''where did all these
contaminants  come from? what other contaminants are there? what
exposure  have we all had all these years? and last, what do we do
about  it?''
for  the tribes, the waiting could mean sacrificing tradition.
''repatriation  is important for preserving our culture and
educating  our youth, and carrying on our religion as it always
was,''  hostler said. ''at this time, hopefully we'll find solutions
on  how to get the poisons out.''

[HEADLINE] :  report: deaf student struck in head
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- people who knew gallaudet university freshman
eric  franklin plunkett say he had no enemies.
that's  why the beating death of plunkett, 19, who was deaf, had
cerebral  palsy and was a leader of a gay campus group, is that much
harder  to accept.
''the  biggest question here now is, 'why?''' chester virnig,
plunkett's  mentor and a math teacher at the minnesota state academy
for  the deaf, told the st. paul pioneer press.
gallaudet  was established by congress in 1864 and is the
nation's  only liberal arts university for the deaf and
hearing-impaired.  it has about 2,000 students.
plunkett,  of burnsville, minn., was found in his dormitory room
thursday  night after a student asked an official to check on him,
police  cmdr. jennifer greene said. plunkett had not been seen for
more  than a day.
an  autopsy has not been completed, but greene said a preliminary
report  showed plunkett died of blows to the head. police told the
washington  post they have no suspects and no motive, although they
have  found what they believe to be the weapon. they would not say
what  it was or where it was found.
chief  medical examiner jonathan l. arden would not say how long
plunkett  may have been dead before his body was found. greene would
say  only that plunkett may have been dead for some time.
plunkett  was secretary of the lambda society, a gay and lesbian
organization  of about 20 students. the student-run group is a
university  club for gay and straight students, said club president
thomas  green.
plunkett  ''was very motivated and he had a real desire to see
the  organization grow,'' green said.
police  said there was no evidence that punkett's involvement in
the  club was related to his death.
students  described plunkett as friendly, somewhat shy and handy
with  a computer.
''he  is a very sweet guy. he had high expectations for his
future,''  said jean frink, a freshman.
at  the minnesota state academy for the deaf in faribault,
plunkett  managed the football and basketball teams. he had taken
home  so many honors when he graduated from the 12th grade --
including  being named salutatorian of his class -- that those who
knew  him wondered if enough plaques had been made.
''i'm  smiling, because it seems every time an award was
announced,  he was up there -- up and down, up and down,'' linda
mitchell,  the school's superintendent, told the star tribune of
minneapolis.
 ''i  can't imagine, i just can't imagine him having an enemy in
the  world,'' she said.

[HEADLINE] :  thriller depicts n.korean soldiers
[TEXT]
seoul,  south korea (ap) -- wolves, monsters, baby-snatchers.
throughout  the cold war, the south korean government pedaled
propaganda  about the denizens of its once-bitter foe, communist
north  korea.
now,  with reconciliation blooming on the korean peninsula,
southerners  are hungry to know what their old and mysterious enemy
is  really like.
they're  getting a warmer view at the cinema this month, where a
new  thriller depicts north korean soldiers as funny and vulnerable,
rather  than stereotypically cruel and inhuman.
since  it opened sept. 9, ''joint security area'' has drawn more
than  2 million viewers in a country of 47 million people and is
poised  to become south korea's biggest movie hit.
the  title of the tale about a murder investigation that
threatens  to topple the uneasy peace on the korean peninsula refers
to  the neutral border area in the demilitarized zone, or dmz. u.s.
soldiers  operate in the area, a negotiation site that has been the
scene  of confrontation and violence between the two sides on a few
rare  occasions.
dmz  jitters might wind down a notch soon. at their first-ever
talks  this week, the defense ministers of both koreas said their
soldiers  would cooperate in plans to reconnect a cross-border
railway.
 in  the movie, the lively portrayal of an illicit friendship
between  four south and north korean border guards matches the
curiosity  and yearnings of south koreans after five decades of
hostility.
 ''the  movie showed that ordinary citizens of north and south
korea  could mix together without any problem if it weren't for the
politics  and ideology that separates them,'' said kim yu-kyong, a
26-year-old  employee of an internet company.
tears  have been shed in a few theaters showing ''joint security
area,''  though far fewer than during a far more evocative, and
real-life,  event that helped humanize north koreans.
in  august, south koreans wept as they watched televised images
of  a round of anguished reunions of separated family members from
both  koreas who had not been able to meet in half a century.
the  reunions were the outcome of an unprecedented summit two
months  earlier between leaders of the koreas at which they agreed
to  work toward reunification, a goal expected to take years and
even  decades.
the  rapprochement has fueled south koreans' eagerness to learn
more  about their neighbors. books about the north are selling well,
television  stations show more programs about the north, and north
korea  studies are attracting more university students.
production  on ''joint security area'' began at a time when the
south's  attitude toward the north was softening under the aegis of
president  kim dae-jung and his policy of engaging pyongyang.
''the  north is viewed as the enemy,'' director park chan-wook
said.  ''i want to question whether that's really the right
perspective  on things.''
in  their roles as soldiers of opposing armies, his actors share
cigarettes,  arm wrestle, tell jokes and chat about girlfriends and
favorite  snacks. yet the shadow of the conflict that divided their
peninsula  at the end of world war ii is never distant, and violence
ensues.
 park's  movie departs from the dogmatic tradition of south korean
movies  in the 1960s and 1970s, when military-backed governments
urged  their citizens to trumpet the virtues of their system over
that  of the north.
last  year's homegrown hit, the spy thriller ''swiri'', injected
humanity  into inter-korean intrigue. the plot: a south korean
intelligence  agent falls in love with a north korean terrorist but
ends  up shooting her to death after discovering her true identity.
south  korea has been democratic for a decade, and filmmakers and
other  artists don't have to worry as much about violating
anti-communist  censorship laws that are no longer rigorously
enforced.
 the  penurious film industry in totalitarian north korea clings
to  its formulas.
in  a report last week, the north's foreign news outlet, kcna,
listed  movies such as ''star of korea'' and ''the sun of the
nation''  that glorify the achievements of kim il sung, the late
revered  leader and national founder.
''those  films, widely known as revolutionary ones, give the high
honor  and pride of the nation to the korean people who are
exceptionally  strong in the spirit of worshipping the leader,''
kcna  said.

[HEADLINE] :  work stoppage pressures milosevic
[TEXT]
belgrade,  yugoslavia (ap) -- opposition leaders were fighting to
keep  up the pressure on president slobodan milosevic to step down,
urging  more protests and work stoppages over the weekend to build
on  earlier massive demonstrations.
students  rallied friday in southern yugoslavia, shopkeepers
shuttered  their doors in the east and television workers cut off
transmissions  in the north. the actors' guild declared a strike,
and  most theater and cinema owners said they would shut down.
several  roads were blocked in northern and southern parts of
serbia  and more than 7,000 coal miners stopped work in kolubara, 25
miles  south of belgrade. two protests in belgrade's main republic
square  drew more than 50,000 people.
police  briefly blocked one of three main bridges over the sava
river,  trying to prevent people and a column of about 100 taxi
drivers  from joining the evening protest.
opposition  leaders want the protests to pressure the yugoslav
strongman  to admit that challenger vojislav kostunica won sunday's
election  by a wide margin. milosevic admits he finished second, but
his  government says the vote was so close that an oct. 8 runoff is
necessary.
 another  critic of milosevic, bernard kouchner, the u.n.
administrator  of kosovo, accused the yugoslav president of
manipulating  votes cast in that southern yugoslav province.
''this  man is a liar,'' kouchner said of milosevic and of his
supporters'  claims that 140,000 votes were cast in kosovo, compared
to  the no more than 40,000 counted by u.n. monitors.
the  gatherings in belgrade were hastily organized and announced
late  thursday night, hence drawing smaller crowds. news of
opposition  activity travels with difficulty -- mostly by word of
mouth  -- since the lone independent radio station was off the air in
central  belgrade, where most of the capital's residents live, and
the  cellular phone network was jammed during the protests.
outside  belgrade, thousands of high school students shunned
classes  in nis, serbia's third-largest city, and spilled into the
streets  -- some jumping out of first floor classroom windows in
their  haste to attend the protest. waving anti-milosevic banners,
they  chanted: ''save serbia and kill yourself, slobodan,'' while
taxi  drivers blockaded adjoining streets.
nis  mayor zoran zivkovic told an evening rally attended by about
40,000  people that the protests will last ''up to seven days,'' and
that  they will start in full force on monday.
about  20,000 people gathered in kragujevac and 10,000 in
kraljevo  in central serbia. in novi sad, the second-largest serbian
city,  six employees of the state television were fired for wanting
to  organize a strike.
similar  walkouts -- joined by shopkeepers and company employees --
were  staged in a dozen other cities and towns across serbia,
including  the opposition strongholds of cacak and sabac.
also  friday, serbia's opposition lodged an official complaint
with  the federal election commission, providing their own tally
that  showed kostunica beat milosevic 51.34 percent to 36.22 percent
in  sunday's vote.
if  the commission fails to respond to their complaint, the
opposition  will press the case to the country's constitutional
court.
 vladeta  jankovic, an opposition leader, told the evening rally
in  belgrade that greece and norway have agreed to send delegations
to  arbitrate over the election dispute. his claim could not be
independently  confirmed.
many  foreign leaders, including president clinton, have promised
to  lift sanctions if kostunica's victory is respected.
u.s.  defense secretary william cohen has praised the growing
anti-milosevic  movement, and noted, without giving specifics, that
american  forces were ''prepared for contingencies.''

oakland,  calif. (ap) -- jason giambi hit his 42nd homer and the
oakland  athletics seesawed past seattle into the al west lead with
a  7-5 victory friday night over the texas rangers.
randy  velarde's go-ahead, two-run single in the sixth inning
sent  the a's to a half-game edge over the mariners, who lost to
anaheim  9-3. cleveland is one game behind seattle for the wild card
spot.
 velarde  singled off francisco cordero (1-2) to break a 3-all
tie.  in the same inning, matt stairs scored when giambi's grounder
was  misplayed by third baseman mike lamb.
giambi  hit a solo homer in the fourth. he has 12 home runs and
29  rbis so far in september.
jim  mecir (10-3) pitched two innings for the win. jason
isringhausen  worked the ninth for his 32nd save.
texas  closed to 6-5 in the eighth when royce clayton singled
home  a run and chad curtis had his third rbi groundout of the game.
the  a's got a run in the bottom half when third baseman scott
sheldon  made an error on stairs' grounder.
the  athletics are hoping to gain some playoff ground against the
al's  worst second-half team and avoid a trip to tampa bay for a
makeup  game monday.
olmedo  saenz hit an rbi single in the fifth to give the a's a
3-2  lead. but the rangers tied it in the sixth on curtis' rbi
grounder.
 texas  starter kenny rogers got a no-decision, leaving intact his
streak  at the coliseum.
rogers,  formerly with the a's, has won his last 17 decisions at
the  coliseum, last losing on aug. 7, 1994. it is the longest streak
for  a pitcher in a single ballpark since minnesota's frank viola
won  19 in a row at the metrodome from may 27, 1987 to july 22,
1988.
 rogers  went 4 1-3 innings, allowing three runs on five hits.
curtis'  grounder in the first inning was bobbled by shortstop
miguel  tejada and scored a run. tejada had not made an error in a
career-high  29 games.
lamb  scored on sheldon's sacrifice fly in the fourth. giambi
homered  to start the bottom half and tejada scored on eric chavez's
grounder.
 saenz's  rbi single off rogers in the fifth inning scored
velarde,  who also singled. velarde was 3-for-4.
notes:  rangers pitching coach dick bosman will not be back with
the  team next season, manager johnny oates said. bosman, the
rangers'  pitching coach for the past six years, was not with the
team  in oakland for their three-game series against the athletics.
...  luis alicea walked to lead off the game, then left because of a
strained  left calf. the injury had been bothering him prior to the
game.  ... a's left fielder ben grieve was a late scratch from
friday  night's lineup with a sore neck. the a's shifted rookie
terrence  long to left field and brought in bo porter to play
center.

[HEADLINE] :  mets 11, expos 2
[TEXT]
new  york (ap) -- the new york mets took care of business early,
getting  their offense and ace pitcher tuned up for the playoffs.
jay  payton's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run first
inning  as the new york mets cruised to an 11-2 victory over the
montreal  expos on friday night.
payton  drove in a career-high four runs, robin ventura had his
24th  home run and three rbis, and mike hampton allowed three hits
in  five strong innings to give the nl wild card mets their third
straight  win and sixth in seven games.
''mike  got a good workout in, and the guys swung the bats real
well,''  mets manager bobby valentine said. ''we just want to get
through  this where we have good health, both physically and
mentally.  that's important.''
the  mets sent nine to the plate in the first, giving hampton
(15-10)  a six-run cushion and sending the expos to their seventh
loss  in a row.
hampton  was on cruise control, retiring his last eight batters
before  leaving after the fifth inning. hampton, the mets' possible
game  1 starter against san francisco or st. louis in the first
round  of the nl playoffs next wednesday, struck out four and walked
one.
 ''the  first couple of innings were pretty long,'' said hampton,
who  threw just 64 pitches on a cool night at shea stadium. ''it
took  me a while to get loose and get warmed up, but i felt a lot
more  comfortable in my last two innings.''
mike  thurman (4-9) got into trouble early.
timo  perez led off with a bloop single out of thurman's reach
and  third baseman mike mordecai couldn't make a play. thurman then
walked  darryl hamilton, edgardo alfonzo and mike piazza to force in
a  run. ventura made it 2-0 with a base hit that went off second
baseman  jose vidro's glove.
''the  first hit of the game was one of those things, and it just
sort  of snowballed from there,'' thurman said. ''i didn't seem to
be  able to get anybody out.''
payton  followed with the mets' team record-tying eighth grand
slam  of the season. payton hit a 2-1 fastball into the back of the
expos  bullpen in left field to give the mets a 6-0 lead.
''the  last time i faced these guys, they threw me a lot of
breaking  balls, so i was thinking i might get a fastball,'' payton
said.  ''i was just looking for something over the middle of the
plate,  and fortunately it was something i could drive.''
the  mets, who had 11 hits and used 16 of 19 available position
players,  added four more runs in the second on rbi singles by
alfonzo  and piazza, and a two-run homer by ventura off julio
santana.
 ''a  lot of runs scored in the first two innings,'' expos manager
felipe  alou said. ''it's real tough when that happens. and
(thurman)  didn't throw very well, i didn't think.''
thurman,  winless in six starts, lasted just one-plus inning and
allowed  eight runs, six hits and three walks.
''no  sense in trying to analyze it,'' thurman said. ''the
season's  over for me. there's no reason to try to figure it out
now.  it was bad, and that's all i can say.''
the  expos got a run in the seventh when vidro hit a leadoff
double  against john franco, and went to third on orlando cabrera's
fly  to center. vidro scored when third baseman jorge velandia
bobbled  michael barrett's grounder and threw high to matt franco,
pulling  him off first base for an error to make it 10-1.
the  mets got their final run in the seventh when joe mcewing
scored  on vidro's error while trying to complete a double play.
the  expos added a run in the eighth when terry jones hit a
leadoff  triple, and fernando seguignol drove him in with a
groundout  to shortstop.
notes:  valentine and gm steve phillips both said the team had not
made  final decisions on the rotation or the 25-man roster for the
playoffs.  phillips, valentine and mets coaches met for about an
hour  friday, and will meet again within the next three days to make
final  decisions. ... only derek bell and benny agbayani, both
recovering  from injuries, and todd pratt did not play for the mets.
...  the mets also hit eight grand slams last season. ... the expos
have  given up an nl-record 12 grand slams this season.

alaska  leaders praise bush's oil plan
anchorage,  alaska -- texas gov. george w. bush's plan to open up the arctic

[HEADLINE] :  jury rules for clint eastwood
[TEXT]
san  jose, calif. (ap) -- clint eastwood was cast as the villain
but  considered himself the hero. in the end, a federal jury saw
things  his way.
eastwood  was cleared friday of having to pay damages to a
disabled  woman who sued him because his historic inn near carmel
lacked  wheelchair access. the jury deliberated less than five hours
in  siding with eastwood, who claimed he had been set up.
''i  think there were too many lies told in court and i think the
jury  could see through that,'' eastwood said shortly before he
thanked  the jurors, signed autographs for them and let court
marshals  take pictures with him.
the  plaintiff, 51-year-old diane zum brunnen, who has muscular
dystrophy,  was not in court when the verdict was read. her
attorneys  said they were considering an appeal and said eastwood's
celebrity  status influenced the jury.
zum  brunnen sued eastwood under the americans with disabilities
act  in 1997, a year after she and her husband, michael, say they
had  dinner at mission ranch. the couple from alameda complained
that  the wheelchair-accessible bathroom was in another building,
more  than 200 feet away, across a driveway; the only accessible
guest  room was $225 a night, when other rooms were as low as $85;
and  there was no ramp to the main office.
after  a seven-day trial, the jury found eastwood liable for two
minor  violations: not enough signs to the restroom and no ramp
access  to the hotel office. but they said zum brunnen deserved
nothing  in damages.
eastwood  had contended that zum brunnen and her husband didn't
eat  dinner at the ranch on jan. 21, 1996, as they claimed, but
instead  stopped by to snap a quick picture of the office they could
use  in a lawsuit.
the  picture was taken some distance from the office, with cars
in  the foreground, on a sunny day.
the  zum brunnens said in depositions they took the picture after
dinner  -- when it would have been dark -- but said at trial it was
taken  before dinner.
a  surveyor testified that the picture was taken at 12:05 p.m.,
which  apparently convinced the jurors that the zum brunnens'
stories  had holes.
''we  kind of didn't think she was really there for dinner,''
said  juror lorenzo gutierrez, 37.
zum  brunnen's attorneys admitted there were inconsistencies but
chalked  that up to the passage of time, rather than a failed
conspiracy  to nail eastwood. the zum brunnens' phone number is
unlisted;  they could not be reached for comment.
eastwood,  a former mayor of carmel, said he has tried to provide
disabled  access in his renovations to the 150-year-old ranch, which
he  bought in 1987, while preserving the inn's historic feel.
''i'm  not against the ada; i want to make that clear,'' he said.
though  zum brunnen's side portrayed the case as a simple fight
for  a disabled woman's civil rights, it was impossible to ignore
the  70-year-old eastwood's role. both sides accused the other of
seeking  a ''fistful of dollars'' -- a reference to his 1964 western.
eastwood  was asked outside court if this would have been the
verdict  he would have scripted had the case been a movie.
''as  a matter of fact,'' he said, smiling, ''it's not a bad
ending,  is it?''

[HEADLINE] :  fina suspends italian coach
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- international water polo officials have
suspended  italy's coach ratko rudic a year from any fina events for
his  angry display after his team lost to hungary in the olympic
quarterfinals.
 fina  officials met at the sydney international aquatic center on
saturday.  in a statement, they said that rudic was disciplined for
''having  brought the sport of water polo in disrepute.''
rudic,  who won golds with yugoslavia in 1984 and 1988 and with
italy  in 1992, chased the officials after the game and was arguing
so  loudly a uniformed officer stepped between him and the scorer's
table  at the ryde aquatic leisure center.
in  a post-game conference, rudic accused officials of conspiring
against  his team. ''i have no proof,'' he said through an
interpreter.  he said the conspiracy might have been held through
secret  meetings. ''it's too sophisticated for me,'' he said.
italy  appealed the game on a technical error and asked it be
replayed,  but it was denied by fina.
rudic  is not expected to be at italy's games the rest of the
olympics.
 also,  fina suspended three italian players for their conduct in
slamming  the pooldeck and arguing with officials following friday's
loss.
 roberto  calcaterra was suspended for four international games.
his  brother, alessandro, was suspended for two games and goalie
francisco  attolico was suspended a game.
croatia's  dubravko simenc was suspended a game for arguing with
an  official after his team fell to spain, 9-8. simenc pointed and
yelled  at an official once the game ended.

''right  now france is our toughest game,'' coach rudy
tomjanovich  said.
on  friday night, lithuania provided a tougher test than anybody
would  have ever imagined. no more than three points separated the
teams  over the final 15&amp;frac12; minutes and the game wasn't decided until
the  final shot -- a 3-pointer by sarunas jasikevicius -- was
off-target  at the final buzzer.
the  final score of 85-83 represented the closest game for an
american  men's team in the olympics since 1988 -- the final year
that  collegians represented the united states.
''we  were fighting for our lives,'' ray allen said. ''it would
not  have been very fun to play for the bronze medal. but these
teams  are good, and we know that on sunday we could be in the same
situation  if we don't come out and just play the game of
basketball.''
 aside  from friday night's near-miracle, the surprise of the last
few  days of the tournament has been france. after finishing fourth
in  group a to barely make it to the medal round, the french rolled
past  canada, the first place team in group b, and then knocked off
the  host team, australia, with ease.
the  french players hugged each other and celebrated after
beating  the aussies like they had won the gold medal, knowing in
the  back of their minds that they really have no chance to beat the
americans.  a few hours later, they may have been reconsidering
their  earlier thoughts
''i  just wanted to get the silver medal, so i played my best,''
france  center frederic weis said.
could  there be another surprise in store?
''i  don't know if it's possible,'' weis said, ''but we'll see. a
game  is a game, so we'll try.''
france  scored 94 points against the americans in the preliminary
round  and lost by just 12 in a game that was highlighted by vince
carter  soaring over the head of the 7-foot-2 weis for an incredible
slam  dunk.
''am  i the first guy he dunked against?'' weis asked friday,
laughing  at his own humor.
france  will look to get most of its offense from guards laurent
sciarra  and antoine rigaudeau, both of whom are a threat from
3-point  range.
rigaudeau  is shooting 37 percent from 3-point range in the
olympics  and is averaging a team-high 13.0 points per game, while
sciarra  has shot 42.3 percent from 3-point range while averaging
10.1  points per game. weis is their leading rebounder, and guard
makan  dioumassi is their defensive stopper off the bench.
france's  third-leading scorer, yann bonato, ruptured his
achilles  tendon against canada and has already returned home.
''since  we played well in our loss to the united states we have
lost  all our inhibitions,'' france coach jean pierre de vincenzi
said.  ''we are happy. we have to be. this has not happened for us
since  1948.''
the  americans, meanwhile, were feeling a huge sense of relief
saturday  after avoiding what would have been one of the biggest
upsets  in the history of basketball, olympics or otherwise.
unable  to create turnovers with their pressure defense and
unable  to pull away from the no-quit lithuanians, the u.s. team was
further  flummoxed by lithuania's use of a tight 2-3 zone defense.
the  americans repeatedly pounded the ball inside, where they were
quickly  double-teamed, and were often unsuccessful trying to shoot
over  the zone from 3-point range.
incredibly,  it came down to a final shot that might have come
closer  had jason kidd not been playing such tight defense on
jasikevicius.
 ''i  had a sigh of relief when i saw that the ball didn't touch
anything  and the time had expired off the clock,'' ray allen said.
''it  was a situation we put ourselves in, but when we win the gold
medal  we can definitely say that we earned it.''
first,  however, the americans have to earn it one last time.
tip-off  for the gold medal game is 10 p.m. edt saturday.
lithuania  plays australia in the bronze medal game at 8 p.m.
edt.

[HEADLINE] :  felix savon wins boxing gold
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- felix savon didn't look like a winner,
but  he was. so was cuba, which will go home with its usual olympic
boxing  medal haul.
savon  was bleeding badly from a deep cut under his left eye as
his  fight with russia's sultanahmed ibzagimov drew to an end
saturday.  by that time, though, he had landed his big right hand
enough  to secure his third olympic heavyweight boxing gold.
savon  became only the third boxer to win three olympic gold
medals,  joining former cuban heavyweight teofilo stevenson and
hungary's  lazlo papp as triple gold medalists.
three  of savon's teammates also won gold medal fights, giving
the  powerful cuban team four gold medals -- the same total it won in
atlanta  -- and two bronze.
six  more gold medal bouts will be fought sunday, but no cubans
are  in them. no americans fought saturday, but two are in gold
medal  bouts on sunday.
savon,  who won gold medals in 1992 and 1996 and is a six-time
world  amateur champion, came into the ring with a mark under his
left  eye that appeared swollen from a previous fight.
it  didn't stop him from piling up points against the russian,
who  had trouble getting inside the reach of the 6-foot-6 cuban
heavyweight.  a punch in the fourth round opened a deep cut below
the  eye, but savon was allowed to continue and won 21-13.
as  savon went back to his corner, blood was streaming down his
face  from the cut.
a  few moments later, though, he was happily dancing in the ring,
waving  a cuban flag in victory.
''i'm  really happy. i dedicate this to the people of cuba,''
savon  said.
the  33-year-old savon has dominated amateur heavyweight boxing
for  the last decade, though there were whispers that he was fading
as  he got off to a rocky start in his first fight before beating
his  nigerian opponent.
michael  bennett was next for savon, who used his powerful right
hand  to pile up enough points to stop the inexperienced american
late  in the third round.
''he's  a great warrior,'' bennett said.
savon  was cut under the left eye in a semifinal fight he won
over  a german, but was allowed to continue and fight in the gold
medal  bout.
ibzagimov,  who landed some telling blows in the final two
rounds,  said he followed the wrong strategy for the fight.
''i  came out and boxed defensively, and it was a mistake,'' he
said.
 other  cubans winning saturday were ortiz rigondeaux, a
20-year-old  newcomer at 119 pounds, and veterans mario kindelan at
132  pounds and jorge gutierrez at 165 pounds.
the  other two gold medals were won by brahim asloum of france at
106  pounds, and oleg saitov of russia at 147 pounds.
it  was the second olympic gold for saitov, who also won in
atlanta.
 ''i  don't know what i'm going to do now,'' saitov said after
beating  sergei dotsenko of the ukraine, 24-16. ''i don't like
planning  ahead. i will just let things happen.''
saitov's  win brightened the day for the russian team, which came
into  the finals with the most boxers still in the competition --
five  -- but lost three of four fights.
the  first boxing gold went to asloum, who earlier in the
tournament  had beaten favored brian viloria of the united states at
106  pounds.
asloum  was fighting perhaps the smallest boxer in 4-foot-11
rafael  lozano of spain, who was fighting in his third olympics.
lozano,  who won a bronze medal in atlanta, fought hard but just
couldn't  keep the pressure on asloum, who was wearing his hair in
his  country's colors of white, blue and red.
''i  wanted the gold, but i got the silver. i hope my girlfriend
will  talk to me tonight,'' lozano said.

one  more win will give the san francisco giants something they
haven't  had in almost 40 years -- the best record in baseball.
a  4-3 win over the arizona diamondbacks on friday night improved
the  nl-leading giants to 96-64, two games ahead of atlanta and st.
louis  (each 94-66), which both lost. the chicago white sox are also
94-66  for the best record in the al.
san  francisco has not had the best record in baseball since
1962.
 in  other nl games, it was cincinnati 8, st. louis 1; colorado 4,
atlanta  2; new york 11, montreal 2; los angeles 3, san diego 0;
florida  7, philadelphia 1; pittsburgh 8, chicago 4; and milwaukee
13,  houston 3.
rich  aurilia hit a tiebreaking homer and drove in three runs as
the  giants clinched at least a tie for the majors' best record.
''i  think a lot of people have success here,'' said aurilia, who
homered  for the second time in four games at phoenix, all giants'
wins.  ''it's a good hitter's park, got a good backdrop to hit, and
the  ball carries.''
san  francisco would be wise to clinch home-field advantage
throughout  the nl playoffs: it finished with the majors' best home
record  (55-26).
livan  hernandez (17-11) allowed two runs in eight innings. robb
nen  pitched the ninth for his career-high 41st save, 28th straight,
giving  up a run on luis gonzalez's grounder.
''i'm  just glad robb nen closed it out,'' manager dusty baker
said.  ''and livan? that was a tremendous performance -- a gutsy
performance.  he was in trouble a couple of times and got out. that
was  some big hitting from richie, too.''
brian  anderson (11-7), who went into the game tied with greg
maddux  for the best walks-to-innings ratio in the nl, issued a
career-high  five walks. he gave up seven hits and four runs in 6
2-3  innings.
reds  8, cardinals 1
ron  villone struck out a career-high 16 in st. louis, tying a
reds  franchise record for strikeouts by a left-hander set by
noodles  hahn in 1901.
villone  (10-10) pitched a two-hitter and had three singles.
the  nl central champion cardinals are tied with atlanta for the
second-best  record in the nl.
garrett  stephenson (16-9), pitching for the first time in 13
days,  gave up five runs on three home runs in five innings and has
a  6.60 era in five september starts.
rockies  4, braves 2
todd  hollandsworth and terry shumpert hit consecutive home runs
off  andy ashby as colorado slowed host atlanta's chances for
home-field  advantage in the postseason.
todd  helton added his 41st home run for the rockies in the
ninth.  the nl east champion braves lost their third straight.
brian  bohanon (12-10) gave up five hits and two runs in 6 2-3
innings.  jose jimenez earned his 24th save.
ashby  (12-13) had won his previous four starts.
mets  11, expos 2
jay  payton's first career grand slam highlighted a six-run first
inning  at new york.
payton  drove in a career-high four runs, robin ventura had a
home  run and three rbis, and mike hampton (15-10) allowed three
hits  in five innings to give the mets their third straight win and
sixth  in seven games.
the  mets sent nine to the plate in the first against mike
thurman  (4-9), sending the expos to their seventh straight loss.
dodgers  3, padres 0
at  san diego, gary sheffield tied the dodgers' franchise record
with  his career-high 43rd homer, and chan ho park struck out 13 and
also  homered in his first major league shutout.
park  (18-10) pitched a two-hitter and extended his scoreless
streak  to 25 innings.
sheffield's  solo shot in the eighth matched duke snider's mark
set  with brooklyn in 1956.
park's  homer leading off the eighth gave the dodgers a
franchise-record  209 home runs, besting the previous mark set by
brooklyn  in 1953. two batters later, sheffield connected off woody
williams  (10-8).
marlins  7, phillies 1
chuck  smith allowed four hits and struck out 11 in eight strong
innings  as florida won at home.
luis  castillo and cliff floyd hit solo home runs for the
marlins,  who have won four in a row and six of seven.
smith  (6-6) won for the fourth time in six starts, striking out
the  side twice.
bruce  chen (7-4) took the loss for philadelphia.
pirates  8, cubs 4
adrian  brown scored the go-ahead run in the seventh and added a
two-run  single in the eighth at pittsburgh.
with  the score tied 4-4 in the seventh, brown pinch hit for
winning  pitcher marc wilkins (4-2) and drew a leadoff walk from
steve  rain (3-4). mike benjamin bunted brown to second and jason
kendall  followed with a grounder that was fielded by first baseman
julio  zuleta.
zuleta  flipped to rain for the out, but brown never stopped and
scored  easily.
brewers  13, astros 3
geoff  jenkins homered twice and jeromy burnitz homered and
scored  four runs at enron field.
the  brewers wrapped up third place in the nl central. the astros
hit  the 90-loss mark for the first time since dropping 97 in 1991.
horacio  estrada (3-0) made his first appearance in the majors
since  may 21. he allowed three runs on five hits and five walks in
5  1-3 innings.
scott  elarton (17-7) lost for the third time in five decisions.

[HEADLINE] :  cuba beats russia 3-2 in volleyball
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the cuban women maintained their
volleyball  dominance with their greatest olympic triumph.
rallying  from a two-game deficit, cuba stormed back to win a
record  third consecutive gold medal with a thrilling 25-27, 32-34,
25-19,  25-18, 15-7 victory over russia saturday.
''we  are cubans. we came here to do the best, and that meant
fighting  until the end,'' captain regla bell said.
cuba  now has won every major international competition since the
1992  games, building an amazing 35-3 record in world championships
and  olympics.
the  difference in ability and execution between the two teams
was  minuscule, and they battled back and forth in a match befitting
the  sport's two superpowers.
cuba  had a 24-21 lead in the opener before letting it slip away.
in  the second game, cuba led 24-23 but again failed to close. both
teams  fought for and lost four more game points until russia pulled
ahead  33-32 on a kill by elena godina, who then closed it out by
stuffing  marlenis costa at the net.
regla  torres, cuba's greatest player, brought her team back by
getting  her 6-foot-3 frame into the path of the russian players as
often  as possible.
''we  were very tense in the first two sets, because of the
pressure  of winning a third gold medal,'' torres said. ''then we
relaxed  and changed the way we played.''
torres,  who became the youngest volleyball gold medalist when
she  played on the 1992 team at age 17, was fearless in the middle,
attacking  the 6-4 godina and russia's other main scoring threat,
6-3  liobov chachkova.
cuba  jumped to a 20-9 lead in the fourth game and withstood a
late  rally. in the deciding game, the cubans took an 8-4 lead and
kept  hitting, as the young russian team folded.
torres  got the final kill, a shot from the right side.
''these  last few games have been the most difficult of my
career,''  torres said. ''this has been one of those achievements i
won't  forget in all my life. i dedicate this win to the whole
country  of cuba. i hope it will be an inspiration to the women of
cuba.''
 the  victory was sweet for cuban coach luis calderon. he had
replaced  eugenio george, the national team coach for 15 years,
after  george left the program in a dispute with sports officials.
fiery  russian coach nikolai karpol, meanwhile, fumed to the very
end.
 karpol,  who led the soviet union to gold medals in 1980 and
1988,  had become the most-booed man among the crowds at sydney
entertainment  center with his fist-shaking tirades against his
players.  as the cubans celebrated, he argued with officials over a
previous  call.
karpol  was under intense pressure to bring home a winner after
the  team's fourth-place finish in atlanta. russia had won four
golds  and three silvers since volleyball became a medal sport in
1964.  besides 1996, the only time the russians had not finished
first  or second was in 1984, when the nation boycotted the los
angeles  games.

[HEADLINE] :  reynolds sails to second gold medal
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- mark reynolds stood barefoot on the
dock,  an american flag in his left hand, and marveled at how he won
his  second olympic sailing gold medal.
his  victory on the pacific ocean on saturday (friday night edt)
was  just the latest example of why the 44-year-old san diego
sailmaker  has been called the star of the star class.
''it  is great to have come from behind,'' said reynolds, a
four-time  olympian. ''there were probably a few people that counted
us  out after six races.
''i  won't say that i counted myself out, but at that point i was
starting  to be concerned more about getting into the medals than
just  worrying about a gold.''
after  a slow start in this regatta, reynolds and his crew,
magnus  liljedahl, 46, of miami, rallied and were assured of at
least  the bronze medal when the day began.
that's  what it looked like they would get after going over the
starting  line early in the 11th and deciding fleet race, the
combination  of aggressiveness and being trapped there by gavin
brady,  a new zealander who lives in america.
reynolds  had to turn back and cross the starting line again.
instead  of being buried in the 16-boat fleet, he ended up gaining
from  a wind shift on the right side of the course, while most
everyone  else thought the first shift would come on the left side.
''we  decided to really go for it at the start and unfortunately,
i  get a little too wound up and we kind of went over everybody and
we  were over the line,'' said reynolds, who also is the current
star  world champion.
reynolds  had enough speed to loop back around and not have that
bad  of a start on port tack, with clear air.
''we  were really fortunate because the right side was a little
favored,''  he said. ''we got a little bit of a shift, and as soon
as  we got that, bang, we tacked back and we knew we were in the
pack,  we knew we had a chance.''
reynolds  rounded the buoy at the top of the windward first leg
in  second place, which, as it turned out, was gold medal position.
he  finished second behind canada's ross macdonald, holding off
britain  skipper ian walker by one point for the gold.
walker  worked his way up to finish third in the final race.
reynolds  and walker came into the race tied for second on points.
defending  star gold medalist torben grael of brazil came in with
a  five-point lead. he was disqualified for being over the line
early  and not turning back to restart, but still got the bronze,
his  fourth olympic medal.
in  the america's cup earlier this year, grael served as
tactician  aboard italy's luna rossa, which was swept by new zealand
in  the finals.
reynolds'  gold helps restore some glitter to the american
sailing  team, which was embarrassed in its home waters in savannah,
ga.,  in 1996 by winning just two bronzes. four years earlier at
barcelona,  the united states won medals in nine of 10 classes,
including  the gold won by reynolds and his crew, hal haenel.
reynolds  won the gold in '92 with one race left to sail. this
time,  he needed all 11 races.
''we  had unbelievable luck in '92,'' reynolds said. ''this was a
lot  more difficult.''
reynolds,  who owns a sail loft near the san diego yacht club,
won  the silver medal in 1988. he is a second-generation star sailor
and  protege of dennis conner.
his  father, jim, who won a star world championship with conner
and  fell just short in three attempts to make it to the olympics,
was  among several family members watching from south head.
reynolds  sailed into the top three with three strong finishes on
friday,  including a first.
he  was assured of a medal in an off-the-water development.
bermuda's  peter bromby sought and received redress for a breakdown
that  kept him from starting one of friday's races, but bromby's
adjusted  score wasn't enough to give him a shot at a medal.
the  deciding race was sailed in moderate breeze and heavy swells
off  the cliffs of the sydney heads.

[HEADLINE] :  4 palestinians dead following clash
[TEXT]
jerusalem  (ap) -- israeli riot police stormed a major jerusalem
shrine  friday and opened fire on stone-throwing muslim worshippers,
killing  four palestinians and wounding 175 in the worst bloodshed
in  four years at the walled compound at the center of the deadlock
in  mideast peace talks.
forty-four  police officers, including the jerusalem chief, were
hit  by stones. the violence quickly spread to jerusalem
neighborhoods  and the west bank, further dimming prospects for an
israeli-palestinian  peace treaty.
the  palestinian authority accused the israeli government of
having  ignited a ''religious war'' and called for a general strike
and  a day of mourning in the palestinian areas saturday. israeli
officials  said they were trying to cool the situation. peace talks
have  been stalled since july over the issue of sovereignty over the
shrines.
 violence  flared again saturday, as hundreds of palestinians
threw  stones at israeli soldiers outside the jewish settlement of
kfar  darom in the gaza strip. israeli troops responded with rubber
bullets.  there was no immediate word on injuries.
tension  has been running high since thursday, when the hawkish
israeli  opposition leader, ariel sharon, toured the jerusalem
shrine,  revered by muslims and jews, to demonstrate that israel is
in  control.
friday's  violence began after muslim noon prayers when the
compound  was filled with 20,000 worshippers. several hundred
palestinians  began hurling stones at israeli riot police huddling
behind  plexiglas shields at the compound's moghrabi gate. officers
fired  barrages of rubber-coated steel pellets and snipers shot live
rounds.  police, many wielding clubs, then charged, chasing
stone-throwers.
 in  the mayhem, palestinian protesters hit by rubber bullets fell
to  the ground and were carried away on stretchers. one young man
was  unconscious, his forehead smeared by blood. others slumped on
the  cobblestone plaza, holding their stomachs and heads in pain.
shouts  of ''allahu akbar,'' or god is great, mixed with the sounds
of  gunfire.
as  news of the clashes spread, riots erupted in other areas of
traditionally  arab east jerusalem and the west bank. in the
biblical  town of bethlehem, rocks littered the main road and thick
clouds  of black smoke from burning tires rose into the skies. one
stone-thrower,  his face covered by a black hood, was taken into a
chokehold  by israeli troops.
by  day's end, four palestinians were dead and at least 175 were
wounded  by rubber bullets and live rounds, most shot in the upper
body,  hospital officials said. forty-four israeli policemen and 15
civilians  were hurt by stones. eight cars, including police vans
and  ambulances, were set on fire or had windshields smashed.
one  of the dead, bilal afani, 26, was a palestinian laborer from
the  west bank suburb of abu dis. before leaving his home friday, he
had  talked about having a party later in the day for his daughter's
first  birthday, said bilal's brother, ahmed.
''i  don't know if i am sad or happy, because my brother gave his
blood  for al aqsa (the main jerusalem mosque), and this is an honor
for  the family,'' said ahmed afani after thousands attended his
brother's  funeral.
the  36-acre walled shrine is known to jews as the temple mount,
site  of their former biblical temple, judaism's holiest site. to
muslims,  it is haram as-sharif, or noble sanctuary, home to two
major  mosques that mark the spot where tradition says the prophet
muhammad  ascended to heaven.
the  palestinian cabinet said after its weekly meeting friday
that  israeli troops opened fire ''without warning and without
justification  in a planned attack, and after the failure of
sharon's  visit.''
as  the clashes raged, sharon defended his visit to the shrine.
''the  state of israel cannot afford that an israeli citizen will
not  be able to visit part of his country, not to speak about the
holiest  place for the jewish people all around the world,'' sharon
told  cnn.
jerusalem's  hawkish mayor, ehud olmert, a member of sharon's
likud  party, accused palestinian security forces of orchestrating
the  violence.
however,  israel's police minister and acting foreign minister,
shlomo  ben-ami, said he believed the riots were spontaneous. ''our
assessment  is that this is largely linked to this visit (by
sharon),''  ben-ami said, adding that neither the palestinian
authority  nor the israeli government had an interest in an
escalation.
 friday's  clashes were preceded by two deadly attacks on israeli
troops.  on wednesday, an israeli soldier was killed in a bomb
attack  in the gaza strip. on friday morning, a palestinian
policeman  opened fire on israeli colleagues patrolling the west
bank  town of qalqiliya, killing one of the israelis.
israel  barred its citizens from entering palestinian-run areas
to  prevent further friction, and israeli prime minister ehud barak
ordered  more police to be deployed in jerusalem. the violence came
at  the start of the jewish new year which ushers in a 10-day period
of  contemplation and prayer.
ben-ami  and arafat spoke separately by phone with u.s. secretary
of  state madeleine albright on friday. ben-ami tried also tried to
reassure  the palestinians, saying israel was not trying to
challenge  the right of muslims to worship at the haram as-sharif.
the  violence came at a time of increased tensions between
israelis  and palestinians, and at a time of deadlock in peace
treaty  talks. the negotiations are hung up because of rival claims
to  sovereignty over the mosque compound. both sides have said they
would  not grant the other sole control. u.s. mediators have floated
compromise  ideas, but none has been accepted by both israel and the
palestinians.

[HEADLINE] :  controversial calls plague taekwondo
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the last impression the people running
taekwondo  want its olympic debut to leave is that it's just too
korean  for the rest of the world to ever really break into.
but  while the world taekwondo federation took pains to keep that
from  happening, they weren't able to escape a little controversy.
and  perhaps a bit of sour grapes.
to  make sure the nation that created taekwondo -- the ''way of
the  hand and foot'' -- didn't completely dominate the medals, each
country  except host australia was limited to only four athletes in
the  sydney games, where eight golds were contested.
as  a result, the breadth of the competition was better than most
would  have thought.
nearly  50 nations, from austria to venezuela, entered. taekwondo
even  provided vietnam with its first-ever olympic medal -- a silver
for  tran hieu ngan in the women's 57-kilogram class.
even  some traditional rivals were impressed.
''i  watched two days of taekwondo, and i think it is in many
ways  superior to karate,'' said yushiro yagi, head of japan's
olympic  delegation.
but  despite large and very spirited crowds each day, the sport's
debut  was marred by a few bumps.
like  most sports involving judges, the point system posed a
problem.
 charles  bayou, an official with the ivory coast team, said he
was  unhappy about the refereeing. he was so upset that he even wept
during  a match involving ivorian player n'guessan sebastien konan.
konan  lost to mexico's victor manuel estrada garibay by a score
of  7-4 in a repechage match for the bronze medal.
''i  am a little bit disappointed at the results, which were
unfair,''  bayou said. ''i don't know why they did not count
correctly.''
 in  taekwondo, three judges sit around the square fighting area.
when  they believe a competitor has scored a valid kick, they press
a  red or blue button corresponding with the color of the athlete's
headgear.  the athlete with the most points after three three-minute
rounds  is the winner.
unless  the buttons are pressed virtually simultaneously, the
points  won't resgister, however. and there is always room for
dispute  over what constitutes a valid scoring kick.
halfway  through the four-day competition, two unofficial
complaints  were lodged over point disputes, both in bouts that went
in  favor of australians, prompting the world taekwondo federation
to  issue a statement in its own defense.
''the  wtf has placed a top priority on impartiality in order to
present  this first-time medal sport in the best possible light,''
it  said. the statement noted that judges found to make repeated
arbitrary  calls can be suspended for up to four years.
questions  also were raised over whether judges were unnecesarily
hard  on the korean entrants, allegedly because the wtf believes it
would  be better for the sport's future for korea not to be too
dominant.
 but,  with korea doing quite well, those claims are hard to
support.
 with  just one athlete still to compete, korea had won two golds
and  one silver, pretty much as it had expected coming into the
games.
 ''i've  no big complaint,'' said south korean coach kim jong-ki.
kim  said the one gold that got away -- when sin jun-sik lost to
america's  steve lopez -- was lost in a close, but fair, bout.
''the  decision could go either way,'' he said. ''our player has
superior  techniques, but could not use them because of his
opponent's  height advantage.''
kim  admitted that the most important thing for korea at these
games  is keeping taekwondo's olympic future alive, not taking home
all  the golds.
''i  don't know if there is any subtle effort by referees to
check  and balance our supremacy in the sport,'' he said. ''but i
agree  that spreading the golds among a variety of countries would
help  promote taekwondo worldwide.''
french  team coach philippe bouedo wrote off the complaints as
mostly  just sour grapes.
''the  refereeing so far has been very good and fair,'' he said.
''when  you lose, you are upset. when you win, you are happy.''

[HEADLINE] :  haiti leader faces murder charges
[TEXT]
port-au-prince,  haiti (ap) -- they came at dawn, forcing their
way  into the shantytown homes, making some victims lie in open
sewers,  beating up old people and children, shooting the ones who
tried  to flee.
no  one knows how many people died that day six years ago in the
brutal  attack by soldiers and right-wing thugs designed to break
the  spirit of supporters of president jean-bertrand aristide, who
had  been deposed by a military coup in 1991.
on  friday, 58 people stood trial for the raboteau massacre in
what  is being billed as a trial of haiti's 1991-1994 military
regime.
 many  of those accused have fled the country and were being tried
in  absentia. former coup leader raoul cedras lives in exile in
panama.  former militia leader emmanuel ''toto'' constant works as a
real  estate agent in new york city's queens borough.
''this  trial is not only that of major human rights offenders.
it  is the trial of the coup d'etat itself and of its atrocities,''
said  michelle karshan, a spokesman for president rene preval.
''the  prosecution is going to show how the high command was
implicated  in the raboteau massacre,'' she said.
some  200 police officers mounted tight security friday at the
courthouse  in gonaives, the city where the killings took place on
april  22, 1994.
the  proceedings started late but a 12-member jury was chosen
friday  afternoon. the trial is expected to last about six weeks.
proceedings  will resume monday.
among  the accused still in haiti are former capt. castera
cenafils,  46, and 21 former soldiers and thugs from the right-wing
fraph  -- the front for the advancement and progress of haiti -- which
constant  led.
no  one knows how many people died in the attack because soldiers
prevented  the victims' families from retrieving bodies from the
sea.
 the  raboteau slayings were part of a series of attacks
undertaken  to break support for aristide, a charismatic slum priest
who  became the caribbean country's first democratically elected
leader  in 1991.
soldiers  and fraph killed at least 3,000 people and maimed
thousands  more before president clinton in 1994 sent 20,000 troops
to  end the bloodshed and halt an exodus of boat people to florida.
aristide  was restored and the army was abolished. aristide was
succeeded  by his hand-picked successor, preval.
under  both men, only a handful of soldiers and militiamen have
been  tried for coup-related crimes and no more than two or three
have  been convicted.
it  took more than three years for haiti's inefficient judicial
system  to prepare the raboteau case.

[HEADLINE] :  texas aclu files suit over drug bust
[TEXT]
austin,  texas (ap) -- a lawsuit was filed against two law
enforcement  agents and a district attorney for their role in an
arrest  stemming from a much-criticized drug bust that prompted
allegations  of racial discrimination in 1999.
forty-three  people were arrested in the bust in tulia, in
northwest  texas. forty were black, and the other three, two whites
and  a hispanic, are said to have ties to the black community.
about  40 residents of the community of 5,000 rallied friday at
the  capitol as will harrell, executive director of texas american
civil  liberties union, announced the lawsuit.
the  suit was filed on behalf of yul bryant, who was arrested in
july  1999 for allegedly selling cocaine.
his  case was dismissed when district attorney terry mceachern
found  out that undercover agent thomas coleman was not certain he
had  bought cocaine from bryant.
the  suit, filed in federal court, accuses mceachern, coleman and
sheriff  larry stewart of falsely arresting, imprisoning and
prosecuting  bryant, who is black. swisher county was also named in
the  suit.
''these  unlawful actions were part of a deliberate plan ... of
targeting  members of the african-american community of swisher
county,  texas and removing them from the area using the legal
system,''  the lawsuit claims.
bryant  is seeking $2 million in damages.
stewart  would not comment on the suit. coleman did not
immediately  return telephone calls made by the associated press.
mceachern  says he does not believe that he did anything wrong
and  that he dismissed the case as soon as he found out coleman was
not  sure bryant had sold him the drugs.
of  those arrested in the same bust as bryant, 17 have pleaded
guilty  and 11 have been convicted.
lawanda  smith said she pleaded guilty to one count of delivering
a  controlled substance because she was afraid of the sentence she
might  receive if she went to trial. but she denies selling drugs to
coleman.
 ''i  have never met the guy,'' she said. ''not ever.''

[TEXT]
los  angeles (ap) -- the union representing 47,000 los angeles
county  employees vowed to start shutting down government offices
one  by one beginning monday after negotiations for a new contract
broke  down.
the  walkout, which would come amid a 2-week-old strike by bus
and  rail operators that has shut down the nation's second-largest
public  transit system, will begin with animal control facilities
and  the county registrar-recorder's office.
''we  are kind of starting slowly and we want to escalate,'' said
annelle  grajeda, general manager of the service employees
international  union local 660.
the  union's declaration friday came as the transit strike was in
its  14th day, with talks having broken off earlier in the week.
on  thursday, members of the union representing 43,000 los
angeles  unified school district teachers also voted to authorize a
strike  if talks with the board of education are unsuccessful. the
union  didn't set a date for a walkout.
the  seiu said monday's action would be the first of several
one-day  ''rolling'' walkouts designed to get the union's point
across  without crippling county services. jails, libraries and the
district  attorney's office would be targeted on wednesday.
hospitals  would be hit on thursday.
if  negotiations for a new contract are still unresolved by oct.
11,  however, the union has said it would call a countywide strike.
the  current contract expires at midnight saturday.
the  union has rejected the county's offer of a 9 percent wage
hike  over three years, saying it wants at least 15.5 percent.
''i  am disappointed that the union has chosen to leave the
bargaining  table,'' said county chief administrative officer david
janssen.

[HEADLINE] :  panama struggles with future
[TEXT]
panama  city, panama (ap) -- panama has struggled to overcome
drug,  arms and money-laundering problems largely borne of its
location  at the hemisphere's hub. now, panama's neighbors are
tossing  it yet another dilemma to deal with -- their discarded
strongmen.
 panama's  position as a place of transit has always been its
greatest  asset, but some recent arrivals are adding to the
country's  already serious image problem, observers say.
the  most recent arrival, peru's reviled former intelligence
chief,  vladimiro montesinos, is seeking to join other undesirables
already  in exile here. president mireya moscoso has yet to make a
decision  on his asylum request.
''now  we are not only seen as a country that launders money,
traffics  drugs and weapons, but also one that serves as a
retirement  paradise for political scum like montesinos,'' said
miguel  bernal, a former adviser to moscoso.
some  here see the asylum issue as a chance for panama to help
solve  its neighbor's problems. panama has granted asylum in recent
years  to at least three high-profile dictators or strongmen, and by
so  doing defused some tense situations in their home countries.
there  had been rumors a coup could occur in peru were montesinos
to  be denied asylum here.
others  see the montesinos case as an opportunity to lift
panama's  image, battered by questions over whether the country
could  clean up crime or run the canal the united states turned over
to  panama in 1999.
''now  is the right moment, when everyone's focused on panama, to
defend  the country against unjust accusations,'' said former
justice  minister renato periera.
accusations  of crime and insecurity have rained down on panama
in  recent years. for example, u.s. conservatives opposed to the
canal  handover said that leftist guerrillas in neighboring colombia
have  frequently crossed into panama, and sometimes get their guns
here.
 and,  when montesinos jetted up from south america on sunday, he
followed  roughly the same route used by traffickers who ship
colombian  cocaine up through panama to the united states. in a
sense,  other people's problems have quickly become panama's.
the  government has not taken into account the repercussions of
giving  montesinos asylum, said teresa de arias, vice president of
the  country's legislature.
''having  a man like him here could endanger the country,'' de
arias  said. ''given his past, he could be the target of all sorts
of  violence.''
panamanians  stress that they have done a good job running the
canal  in the nine months since the united states left; that they
are  serious about fighting drug trafficking, and don't want the
arms  trade from colombia's civil war to spill over into their
country.
 the  last thing the country needs, in these circumstances, is a
man  like montesinos who many consider a gangster.
the  country's banking sector -- a mainstay of the economy, born
out  of the huge amount of shipping transactions and a lax
regulatory  environment -- is laboring under the specter of being
placed  on the ''black list'' of rogue money-laundering countries by
the  international financial action task force.
montesinos  arrived here just as the country's congress is
debating  stiffer laws against money laundering. ''it's just better
not  to be on such a list,'' said ricardo alba, who is the
government's  point man on the laws.
and  anti-asylum demonstrations have broken out here, protests
not  seen since panama gave asylum to the shah of iran in 1979.
since  then, panama has allowed in haitian dictator raul cedras,
reviled  former ecuadorean president abdala bucaram, and former
guatemalan  president jorge serrano elias, who attempted to seize
absolute  power in his country in 1993.
astrid  wolf, one of about 80 people who gathered in an
anti-asylum  protest in panama city on tuesday, put it in simple
terms.
 ''we're  trying to be somebody on the world stage, but with
people  like this here, we won't get anywhere.''

[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the olympic gold and silver medalists
from  atlanta in individual dressage changed places this time around
after  a spirited competition.
anky  van grunsven of the netherlands rode an energetic and
mistake-free  grand prix freestyle for a record score to defeat 1996
olympic  champion isabell werth of germany.
van  grunsven, on bonfire, earned 86.05 percent saturday for a
combined  score of 239.18 from the three days of competition. the
freestyle  by werth, aboard gigolo, was not as fluid, and she earned
82.2  percent for a combined 234.19.
ulla  salzgeber of germany won bronze on rusty with a 80.67
percent  freestyle and a combined score of 230.57.
''isabell  and i have been fighting each other for years,'' van
grunsven  said. ''it has always been close. you get a horse like
bonfire  once in a lifetime. today he was brilliant. no one could be
happier  with a gold medal than i am.''
werth  said she was nervous and too cautious.
''i  tried to be too safe and made mistakes,'' she said. ''but i
feel  i didn't lose the gold. i won the silver.''
the  top 15 riders from two previous grand prix tests rode a
musical  freestyle saturday, including two u.s. riders who were not
in  medal contention.
susan  blinks of wellington, fla., earned 74.37 percent on flim
flam  for a combined 214.65 to move up to eighth from 11th overall.
it  was the sixth-highest score of the freestyle competition.
''what  a boy,'' blinks said of flim flam. ''he was tired and he
really  came through. i've been preparing him for the olympics for
10  years.''
christine  traurig of carlsbad, calif., scored 65.57 percent on
etienne  for a combined 208.21 to drop from 10th to 11th.
''he  was a little bit out of gas today,'' said traurig.
''overall,  i'm pretty happy with his efforts for three days.''
werth  led after the grand prix test during the team competition
wednesday,  but van grunsven pulled ahead in the grand prix special
test  on friday.
van  grunsven earned a standing ovation from the capacity crowd
of  20,000 for her freestyle with a ''song sung blue'' theme.
werth's  music was ''just a gigolo.''
the  president of the judge panel, eric lette of sweden,
announced  later that bonfire's 86.05 percent was a record freestyle
score  in a major competition.
''we  have seen today dressage at its best,'' judge volker moritz
of  germany said.
salzgeber's  performance also won a huge ovation. her music broke
halfway  through her test, and she completed it an hour later after
the  other riders were done.
van  grunsven and werth had announced that the sydney olympics
would  be the last competition for their horses, both 17. they have
gone  head to head for six years.

[TEXT]
denver  (ap) -- the fbi has joined the search for two suspects in
a  scheme to sexually assault women after inviting them to a
lingerie  party.
melissa  m. todd, 22, and james h. gipson, 26, were seen in las
vegas  on wednesday, and investigators believe they may be on their
way  to phoenix, san diego or los angeles, the agency said friday.
the  fbi has obtained federal warrants against the pair for
unlawful  flight to avoid prosecution.
todd  and gipson are suspected in a scheme in which women were
approached  in denver-area malls by a young woman who claimed to be
an  employee of the lingerie chain victoria's secret.
the  woman asked for the victims' phone numbers and addresses,
telling  them she would contact them for a party where they could
try  on and buy lingerie.
when  she picked the women up at their homes, she instead took
them  to a remote location where they were sexually assaulted at
gunpoint.
 police  said more than 20 people were approached in the scheme
and  three women in their late teens or early 20s were assaulted.

[HEADLINE] :  three alleged mob associates arrested in art fraud scam
[TEXT]
new  york (ap) - three mob associates were arrested friday on
charges  of trying to peddle ''cheesy'' fake artworks that they
claimed  were created by picasso, chagall, botero and rubens,
federal  prosecutors said friday.
prosecutors  said the defendants planned to sell the fakes
through  an upscale manhattan gallery for $32 million. federal
agents,  using wiretaps and an informant, killed the alleged scheme
and  no paintings were sold.
prosecutors  said the defendants are dominick ''little dom''
curra,  56, of lawrence, n.y.; kevin mcmahon, 35, of howard beach,
queens;  and robert walsh, 35, of fort lee, n.j. the defendants are
associates  of reputed gambino organized crime soldier charles
carneglia,  prosecutors said.
curra  and walsh were arrested at their homes friday morning.
mcmahon  was arrested in jail where he is already being held on
federal  extortion charges, assistant u.s. attorney andrew weissmann
said.
 all  the defendants were charged with wire fraud, which is
punishable  by up to five years in prison. curra and walsh pleaded
not  guilty when they were arraigned friday in u.s. district court
in  brooklyn.
magistrate  cheryl pollack released curra in $750,000 bond. she
remanded  walsh and scheduled his bail hearing, and mcmahon's
arraignment,  for monday.
weissmann  said the phony art package included two pieces
purportedly  by picasso, one by marc chagall, one by fernando
botero,  and one by peter paul rubens. he said the fakes ''looked
really  cheesy.''
weissmann  said the fake rubens is in fact an authentic
12-inch-by-12-inch  canvas from ''the school of rubens,'' meaning it
was  painted by a rubens-era (1577-1640) artist in rubens' style.
the  rubens-style canvas, worth about $2,000, was stolen from a
private  residence in maryland about 30 years ago, the federal
complaint  against the three men said.
the  three defendants and the informant, who has pleaded guilty
in  another case and is cooperating with prosecutors, planned to ask
$30  million for the ''rubens'' and $500,000 for each of the other
four  fakes.
weissmann  said he did not know where the defendants got the
paintings.
 the  complaint said walsh told the informant in a march 31
telephone  conversation that the rubens was real, had been insured
by  lloyd's of london, and had been owned by a ''real gangster.''

[HEADLINE] :  report: many new york children in federal insurance program ineligible
[TEXT]
	  new york (ap) - up to half of the roughly 538,000 new york
children  enrolled in a federal health care plan are ineligible and
will  be removed from the plan over the next several months, the new
york  times reported saturday.
some  families began receiving notices several weeks ago that
their  children would be removed from the children's health
insurance  program as early as sunday and that they must apply for
medicaid,  the newspaper said.
health  insurance executives and advocates for the poor told the
times  that thousands of new york children were wrongly placed in
the  program largely because participating insurance plans did not
steer  families into medicaid even when it was clear they belonged
there.
 insurance  executives said the state health department did not
instruct  them to screen applicants for medicaid eligibility.
''the  department of health knew exactly what we were doing,''
said  michael a. stocker, president and chief executive of empire
blue  cross and blue shield, which insures 96,000 state children
enrolled  in the program. ''there is no secret about this. and there
is  no question that it is going to create problems.''
john  signor, a spokesman for the state health department, said
the  problems arose because time was needed to iron out the program.
''obviously  our top priority is to get children the health
insurance  they need and deserve,'' signor said. ''the federal
government  is now forcing states to move children who are eligible
for  medicaid into that program.'' he estimated that about 22
percent  of the children would have to be moved, but insurers and
others  put the figure closer to 50 percent.
state  comptroller carl mccall warned the health department
several  times over the last few years that it was enrolling too
many  children who belonged in medicaid, the newspaper said. the
department  responded to a 1998 audit by assuring mccall's office
that  it was requiring insurance carriers to screen applicants.
the  program was intended to insure children from low-income
families  whose incomes are too high for medicaid but too low to
afford  private insurance.
new  york, where the program is known as child health plus, is
one  of 10 states that have established a significant program so
far.  new york's enrolled children comprise roughly one quarter of
all  children in the program nationwide.
the  federal insurance program was approved by congress in 1997
and  is reimbursed by the federal government at a higher rate than
medicaid.  new york gets a 65 percent reimbursement, compared with
50  percent for medicaid.
the  federal government is examining whether new york state may
owe  it money, the times said.

[HEADLINE] :  carl sigman, songsmith who made generations hum, dead at 91
[TEXT]
	  manhasset, n.y. (ap) - carl sigman, who wrote music or words for
dozens  of songs, including the theme song to the 1950's ''robin
hood''  television series, died tuesday at age 91.
one  of sigman's best-known legacies is a phone number. in 1938
he  wrote ''pennsylvania 6-5000,'' in tribute to the hotel
pennsylvania,  where the dorsey brothers, benny goodman and artie
shaw  regularly performed. the glenn miller orchestra recorded the
song.  the phone number, pe6-5000, still rings at the hotel.
sigman  wrote the words to duke ellington's ''all too soon'' in
1940  and ''what now my love,'' for which he wrote english lyrics in
1966  for a french song written four years earlier. herb alpert and
the  tijuana brass, sonny and cher and mitch ryder sang his version.
he  also wrote the words to ''ebb tide,'' a song originally
composed  as an instrumental by the harpist robert maxwell; vic
damone,  the platters and the righteous brothers, among others,
recorded  it.
more  recently, his ''enjoy yourself'' was used in the 1997 woody
allen  movie ''everybody says i love you.''
sigman's  son, michael, noted that a mercedes commercial shown
during  the current olympics used ''enjoy yourself.''
a  graduate of new york university law school, sigman was
admitted  to the bar, but never practiced. instead, he was drawn to
music  and became acquainted with johnny mercer, the lyricist,
vocalist  and composer who became his mentor.
in  1942, sigman was drafted into the army and served in europe
in  the crew of a glider. he was awarded a bronze star for heroism.
he  also wrote what became the 82nd airborne division's official
song,  ''the all american soldier,'' receiving a $25 war bond for
the  achievement.

[HEADLINE] :  mother of two has short-lived career as a bank robber
[TEXT]
	  new york (ap) - a would-be bank robber chose an odd getaway
vehicle  - a slow-moving city bus.
valerie  coletti, 41, allegedly collected $8,300 in cash from the
banco  popular in sheepshead bay and made her escape on a bus on the
b-49  line. the bus was stopped by police about a block from the
bank,  and coletti, a mother of two college-age sons, was arrested.
the  bungled robbery happened friday at about 10:30 a.m., when
coletti  allegedly strode up to a teller's window, holding a blue
bag  and pointing a black gun at the teller, police said.
she  demanded the money and, when the teller fumbled with the
drawer  containing marked bills and exploding cash packets, she
ordered  him to open a second drawer, police said. when the teller
then  had trouble opening that drawer, she allegedly banged the gun
on  the counter, attracting the attention of customers and
employees.
 after  coletti left the bank, an employee ran out and flagged
down  a police van from the 61st precinct.
''the  employee said, 'we've just been robbed, and the lady who
robbed  us is on the city bus that just passed you,''' said police
officer  jeff childs. the cops went after the bus.
with  a description of the robber, childs boarded the bus about a
block  away from the bank and checked out the passengers. the bus
was  full, but childs zeroed in on a woman sitting in the last row,
center  seat.
''she  didn't move, she didn't say a word,'' childs said.
childs  approached her and ordered the woman to put her hands up.
police  recovered two pellet guns from the woman.
coletti  allegedly told police she had taken the bus because she
didn't  have money for a cab. the brooklyn resident was taken into
custody  by federal authorities and was remanded friday night in
brooklyn  federal court.

the  fall of namakaab on friday sealed off the opposition's

the  opposition in the province, mohammed abil, a senior opposition
spokesman,  told the associated press from the besieged region.
the  taliban are now barely 18 miles from farkhar and appear to
be  preparing for a final push to the area, abil said. farkhar lies
155  miles northeast of the capital kabul.
sporadic  artillery fire was exchanged by the two sides early
saturday,  he said.
no  immediate comment was available from the taliban, who now
rule  more than 95 percent of the country, including the capital.
''we  lost namakaab because some of our commanders switched their
loyalties  and joined the taliban ranks along with their men,'' abil
said.
 six  opposition commanders and 200 fighters joined the taliban,
the  taliban-controlled newspaper shariat reported saturday.
the  united nations says that nearly 70,000 people have fled to
neighboring  badakshan province, held by the opposition, to escape
the  fighting. the region is close to afghanistan's frontier with
the  central asian state of tajikistan.
the  taliban, who follow a harsh version of islam, are sunni
muslims  and mostly pashtun, afghanistan's majority ethnic group.
the  opposition, led by ousted president burhanuddin rabbani and
former  defense minister ahmed shah massood, is made up of ethnic
and  religious minorities.

[HEADLINE] :  colombiams apologize to red cross
[TEXT]
bogota,  colombia (ap) -- in an unusual act of contrition,
right-wing  militias in colombia have apologized for dragging a
wounded  guerrilla from a red cross vehicle last week and executing
her.
 the  apology from the united self-defense forces of colombia, an
umbrella  group for the country's militias, was contained in a
letter  faxed to the red cross in bogota on thursday.
''we  accept our responsibility for this lamentable incident that
put  at risk the good work of the international red cross in
colombia,''  the letter said.
the  red cross had no comment on the apology.
in  its letter, the militia group conceded that on sept. 22 three
of  its fighters stopped a red cross vehicle outside apartado, a
town  near the panamanian border.
the  men then grabbed the wounded guerrilla, whom the red cross
was  taking to a hospital, and later killed her. she was a member of
the  leftist revolutionary armed forces of colombia, or farc, the
red  cross said.
apologies  are rare in colombia's brutal, 36-year civil war,
which  has left at least 35,000 people dead, most of them civilians.

[TEXT]
olbia,  sardinia (ap) -- the remains of 10 ships dating back to
the  twilight of the roman empire have been found off northeastern
sardinia  near the port of olbia.
marine  archaeologist rubens d'oriano said friday that the ships
were  likely burned by the vandals of northern europe when they
plundered  olbia in the 5th century.
the  discovery ''is particularly important because it gives us
details  on a specific historical event'' as well as ancient naval
technology,  he said.
d'oriano  said another five ships from the 13th century were
found  in the same area, d'oriano said.
the  wreckage was found during work on an underwater tunnel at
the  port of olbia.
the  roman ships -- some up to 30 yards long -- are believed to be
merchant  vessels. the hulls show signs of fire.
so  far, the wreckage has yielded human bones, oil lamps, coins,
a  statue of the egyptian god osiris, a sapphire, an amphora and
fragments  of a bronze statue.
d'oriano  said divers are still exploring the wreckage.

tegucigalpa,  honduras (ap) -- honduran soldiers launched a search
friday  for a helicopter carrying the chief justice of the country's
supreme  court and five others which disappeared in bad weather.
the  bell-206 helicopter took off from islas de bahia, 180 miles
north  of the capital tegucigalpa, earlier friday and disappeared
from  radar screens shortly after, aviation authorities said.
tropical  storm keith is about 200 miles north of the coast, and
has  drenched northern honduras where the chopper disappeared with
heavy  rains.
honduran  air force officials said they would wait until saturday
to  launch an air search for the craft, but soldiers and police were
already  searching on the ground for judge oscar avila banegas and
the  five others.
besides  banegas, a congressman, the pilot, two court employees
and  banegas' bodyguard were on board. their names were not
immediately  available.
luis  rolando leiva, director of honduras' civil aviation agency,
said  ''the craft went down due to the prevailing bad weather.''

[HEADLINE] :  no injuries in madrid office blast
[TEXT]
madrid,  spain (ap) -- a bomb blamed on a leftist group exploded
saturday  at an office of the ruling popular party in madrid,
causing  minor damage and no injuries, said police.
a  police spokesman in madrid said a woman called police after
the  explosion to say grapo, an elusive group with apparent
anarchist  leanings, planted the bomb in the office in madrid's
hortaleza  neighborhood. nobody was in the building at the time of
the  explosion.
the  homemade bomb, with 3.3 pounds of explosive material, was
left  in the office doorway and a witness told police he saw two
young  men running from the scene shortly before the blast.
the  pre-dawn explosion was the fifth in three days blamed on
grapo.
 on  friday, two men and a woman planted a bomb in a trash bin in
the  barcelona office of el mundo, one of spain's leading
newspapers.  the building was evacuated. when the device exploded,
it  injured two police officers who had rushed to the scene.
on  wednesday, three bombs exploded at temporary employment
agencies  in three spanish provincial capitals, causing considerable
damage  but no injuries. grapo, which has targeted temporary job
offices  in the past, claimed all three.
grapo  has killed some 60 people in sporadic bombings and
shootings  since it emerged in the 1970s.
the  group has never stated clearly its political aims although
it  is believed to go after what it considers to be right-wing and
capitalist  targets.
its  name -- october first anti-fascist resistance group -- comes
from  october 1, 1975, the date of the group's first major attack in
which  it killed four policemen in reprisal for the execution of two
suspected  basque separatists and three anarchists belonging to
frap,  a predecessor group of grapo. the firing squad executions
were  the last by the regime of the late dictator gen. francisco
franco.

[HEADLINE] :  official: us hostage visited rebels
[TEXT]
jolo,  philippines (ap) -- an american being held hostage by
muslim  rebels visited their camp twice before being abducted and
discussed  procuring night vision goggles for them, the philippine
national  police chief said saturday.
jeffrey  schilling, of oakland, calif., was taken captive by the
abu  sayyaf rebels aug. 28 after he visited their camp on southern
jolo  island in sulu province. schilling says rebel leaders abducted
him  after they began suspecting he was a cia agent, which he
denies.
 but  national police chief panfilo lacson said schilling also had
visited  a rebel camp on the nearby province of basilan.
''twice  in the past two years schilling visited the abu sayyaf
camp  in basilan (and met) with abu sayyaf leaders for the
procurement  of night vision goggles,'' lacson said in an interview
with  abs-cbn television.
''because  he went there without any difficulty, we are wondering
why  he was kidnapped, because he went to sulu and transacted
business.''
 the  rebel faction holding schilling previously operated on
basilan,  but fled to jolo to escape a military assault after they
kidnapped  about 50 children and teachers from two schools.
on  sept. 16, the military launched a massive attack on jolo to
rescue  17 other hostages being held by the abu sayyaf, including
schilling  and three malaysians.
philippine  officials have raised questions about schilling's
relationship  with the rebels, although they say they continue to
believe  he is being held against his will.
schilling's  wife, ivi osani, is the second cousin of the abu
sayyaf's  spokesman and the widow of a rebel killed several years
ago  by government troops.
osani,  who went to the rebel camp with schilling but was not
abducted,  is being held by police.
schilling,  24, majored in near east studies at the university of
california  at berkeley and converted to islam in 1994. he is deeply
interested  in the status of muslim minorities in countries like the
philippines,  his family says.
the  abu sayyaf claims it is fighting for an independent islamic
state  in the impoverished southern philippines. in the past six
months  it has kidnapped scores of people. most were released after
libya  and malaysia paid more than $15 million in ransom,
negotiators  say.
several  philippine news reports have accused schilling of
discussing  procurement of supplies such as camouflage uniforms,
combat  boots and night vision goggles from the united states.
schilling's  mother, carol, has denied he was an arms dealer.
on  saturday, at least two rebels were killed and one soldier was
wounded  after a gunbattle erupted between government troops and
about  100 rebels in a mountainous area in patikul town, military
officials  said.

[TEXT]
jerusalem  (ap) -- thousands of rock-throwing palestinian rioters
clashed  with israeli troops across the west bank, gaza strip and
jerusalem  on saturday, and gun battles raged in two areas in what
palestinians  said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
jerusalem  shrine.
in  a second day of bloody clashes, three palestinians, including
a  14-year-old boy, were killed in the west bank, while in gaza a
protester  was comatose with a bullet wound in the head, palestinian
doctors  said. about 325 palestinians were injured, hospital
officials  said.
''the  battle for jerusalem has begun,'' said bassem naim, a
palestinian  activist.
huge  plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose high above
palestinian  towns, and streets were littered with rocks and
overturned  garbage bins.
in  hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene  in taxis. helmeted israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pelles  and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls. gun battles
raged  near the west bank town of nablus and close to the jewish
settlement  of netzarim.
south  of nablus, about a dozen masked palestinians, crouching
behind  walls and olive trees, exchanged fire with israeli troops
for  more than an hour. two palestinians, including a 14-year-old
boy,  were killed in the clash, doctors said. in the west bank town
of  ramallah, a 16-year-old protester was killed, doctors said.
''the  israelis must understand that palestinians can also shoot
and  kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an m-16 assault
rifle  who would not give his name.
near  netzarim, palestinian police in uniform and plainclothes
exchanged  fire with israeli troops.
palestinians  say the trigger for the violence was a visit
thursday  by israel's hawkish opposition leader, ariel sharon, to
the  disputed jerusalem hilltop known to jews as the temple mount
and  to muslims as haram as-sharif, or noble sanctuary. al aqsa is
one  of two major mosques in the walled compound.
in  clashes at the compound friday, six palestinians were killed
and  close to 200 wounded. ''we're going to teach them not to touch
our  holy place,'' said khalil natash, 21, a stone-thrower in the
west  bank town of hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those  killed. ''we will burn the ground underneath the israelis to
stop  them from touching our holy place.''
israeli  prime minister ehud barak appealed to palestinian leader
yasser  arafat to restore calm. he said israel has been showing
''maximum  restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its  citizens and restore order. the violence erupted as israelis
marked  the jewish new year.
palestinian  peace negotiator nabil shaath said israeli security
forces  committed ''premeditated murder'' at the jerusalem shrine
friday.  the violence underscored palestinian demands that israel
must  withdraw from east jerusalem, the sector the palestinians
claim  as a future capital, shaath said.
marwan  barghouti, the fatah leader in the west bank, said he
expected  confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
''the  way the israelis are behaving now in the palestinian
territories  and israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been  done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,''  he said.
many  israelis felt the palestinians were responsible. ''despite
the  fact that there is a peace process, they (the palestinians)
want  to ruin everything,'' said meirav buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from  the town of netanya. ''there won't be peace. there will only
be  war.''
across  the west bank, gaza strip and east jerusalem,
palestinians  observed a general strike and day of mourning
saturday.  shops were closed and children were sent home from
school.  israel barred its citizens from entering the
palestinian-controlled  areas to avoid further friction.
israeli-palestinian  peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty  claims to the shrine. neither side wants the other to
have  full control. all u.s. compromise proposals have been rejected
so  far by the negotiators.
in  visiting the shrine thursday, sharon, who staunchly opposes
concessions  to the palestinians, said he wanted to demonstrate that
israel  is in control there.
the  palestinians accused the israeli government of having
ignited  a ''religious war'' because it did not stop sharon from
visiting  the shrine.
jerusalem's  hawkish mayor, ehud olmert, a member of sharon's
likud  party, accused palestinian security forces of orchestrating
the  violence.

[HEADLINE] :  albright: milosevic is finished
[TEXT]
reykjavik,  iceland (ap) -- secretary of state madeleine albright
urged  russia on saturday to accept that slobodan milosevic was
''finished''  as president of yugoslavia.
albright  was reacting to news that russian president vladimir
putin  had offered to send foreign minister igor ivanov to belgrade
to  talk to both sides in yugoslavia's election standoff.
so  far, russia hasn't taken sides in the dispute over who won
yugoslavia's  presidential vote on sunday. opposition candidate
vojislav  kostunica says he beat president slobodan milosevic
outright,  while milosevic says a runoff is necessary to determine
the  winner because kostunica got less than 50 percent of the vote.
albright  said she planned to speak to ivanov later in the day,
and  would stress that kostunica had won the election.
''i  think the russians need to make clear that they understand
that  this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,''
albright  said at a news conference in reykjavik.
''the  russians need to understand that milosevic lost in this
round.  he is finished. it is time for him to go.''
albright  also said she had spoken to leading parties in the
middle  east peace process in an effort to ease tensions which
erupted  in violence in jerusalem.
she  said that she had telephoned both yasser arafat, the
palestinian  leader, and israel's prime minister ehud barak in a bid
to  keep the peace process on course.
''we  are very concerned about the violence. it is clearly
counterproductive  in the peace process,'' albright said. ''there is
danger  of a cycle of violence developing. the talks are at a very
delicate  stage and it is important that the violence stops.''
albright  stopped briefly in iceland, a nato ally, on her way to
france  and germany, and met with foreign minister halldor
asgrimsson  and prime minister david oddsson.
an  agreement between the two countries for the u.s. use of the
military  base at keflavik in southwest iceland is due for renewal
in  april. iceland relies on nato and the u.s. forces for its
defense.
 albright  said any changes in u.s. commitments to iceland were
unlikely.

jerusalem  (ap) -- thousands of palestinian rock throwers and
several  gunmen clashed with israeli troops saturday in what
palestinians  said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
jerusalem  shrine. six palestinians were killed and about 325
injured  in the worst violence in the west bank and gaza strip in
four  years.
''the  battle for jerusalem has begun,'' said bassem naim, a
palestinian  activist.
palestinian  gunmen and israeli troops exchanged fire in two
locations,  near the jewish settlement of netzarim in gaza and south
of  the west bank town of nablus.
at  the netzarim junction, a palestinian fired shots at an
israeli  army outpost from behind a red truck. soldiers returned
fire,  and several palestinians took cover on the ground, covering
their  heads with their hands, their faces pressed on the asphalt.
one  palestinian man screamed in pain when he was shot in the knee.
paramedics  ran into the line of fire to drag him to safety.
shifa  hospital in gaza city reported three dead -- a 12-year-old
boy,  a palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver.
in  the west bank, three palestinians were killed by israeli
fire,  including a 14-year-old boy shot in the abdomen during a gun

areas,  near the jewish settlement of netzarim in gaza and south of
the  west bank town of nablus.
at  the netzarim junction, a palestinian fired shots at an
israeli  army outpost from behind a red truck. soldiers returned
fire,  and several palestinians took cover on the ground, covering
their  heads with their hands, their faces pressed on the asphalt.
one  palestinian man screamed in pain when he was shot in the knee.
paramedics  ran into the line of fire to drag him to safety.
shifa  hospital in gaza city reported three dead -- a 12-year-old
boy,  a palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver. a fourth
palestinian,  from the town of khan yunis, was comatose with a
bullet  wound to the head.
in  the west bank, four palestinians were killed by israeli fire,
including  a 14-year-old boy shot in the abdomen during a gun battle
between  a dozen masked gunmen and israeli soldiers near nablus. the
gunmen  crouched behind walls and olive trees as they aimed at the
israelis  who took cover behind jeeps.
''the  israelis must understand that palestinians can also shoot
and  kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an m-16 assault
rifle  who would not give his name.
violence  erupted across the west bank, gaza and arab
neighborhoods  of jerusalem. huge plumes of black smoke from burning
tires  rose high above palestinian towns, and streets were littered
with  rocks and overturned garbage trash bins.
in  hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene  in taxis. helmeted israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pellets  and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls.
palestinians  say the trigger for the violence was a visit
thursday  by israel's hawkish opposition leader, ariel sharon, to
the  disputed jerusalem hilltop known to jews as the temple mount
and  to muslims as haram as-sharif, or noble sanctuary.
in  clashes at the compound friday, six palestinians were killed
and  close to 200 wounded. ''we're going to teach them not to touch
our  holy place,'' said khalil natash, 21, a stonethrower in the
west  bank town of hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those  killed. ''we will burn the ground underneath the israelis to
stop  them from touching our holy place.''
israeli  prime minister ehud barak appealed to palestinian leader
yasser  arafat to restore calm. he said israel has been showing
''maximum  restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its  citizens and restore order. the violence erupted as israelis
marked  the jewish new year.
palestinian  peace negotiator nabil shaath said israeli security
forces  committed ''premeditated murder'' at the jerusalem shrine
friday.  the violence underscored palestinian demands that israel
must  withdraw from east jerusalem, the sector the palestinians
claim  as a future capital, shaath said.
marwan  barghouti, the fatah leader in the west bank, said he
expected  confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
''the  way the israelis are behaving now in the palestinian
territories  and israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been  done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,''  he said.
many  israelis felt the palestinians were responsible. ''despite
the  fact that there is a peace process, they (the palestinians)
want  to ruin everything,'' said meirav buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from  the town of netanya. ''there won't be peace. there will only
be  war.''
across  the west bank, gaza strip and east jerusalem,
palestinians  observed a general strike and day of mourning
saturday.  shops were closed and children were sent home from
school.  israel barred its citizens from entering the
palestinian-controlled  areas to avoid further friction.
israeli-palestinian  peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty  claims to the shrine. neither side wants the other to
have  full control. all u.s. compromise proposals have been rejected
so  far by the negotiators.

[HEADLINE] :  nj wines -- a well-kept secret
[TEXT]
shamong,  n.j. (ap) - the workers make their way down row after
row  of leafy green vines, snipping off dangling clusters of smooth,
plump,  deep blue grapes.
it's  harvest time in the vineyards, and this scene is being
repeated  in some of the world's prime wine growing areas - the
bordeaux  region of france, along germany's rhine river, in
california's  napa valley - and in new jersey.
new  jersey?
yes,  new jersey.
from  the rocky hills of warren county to the sandy cape may
county  coastal plain, there are 16 wineries turning out everything
from  merlots to chardonnays to cranberry, apple and blueberry
wines.
 in  fact, the garden state's $10 million-a-year wine industry
might  just be its best-kept agricultural secret.
''it's  an unknown quantity,'' said bill walker, marketing
specialist  at the state department of agriculture. ''ninety percent
of  the state's citizens don't even know that there is a wine
industry.''
 new  jerseyans are a thirsty bunch - the state ranks fifth in the
nation  in per capita wine consumption. but only 1 percent of what's
consumed  here is made in new jersey.
of  the 45 states that make wine, new jersey is among the top 15
in  output, producing about 1 million bottles of wine in 1999. but
wine  spectator magazine, considered by some vinophiles to be the
bible  of wines, has never even reviewed a new jersey wine.
not  because they're not good, magazine spokesman terrence meck
is  quick to point out, but because most of the wineries are too
small.
 ''for  a national publication, we're required to review wines
that  have a much larger, broader distribution,'' he said. ''new
jersey  is known for having a good wine industry, but it's too small
still.''
 that's  about to change. ten to 15 new wineries are expected to
open  in new jersey in the next five to seven years, said joseph
fiola,  a specialist in small fruit and viticulture for rutgers
cooperative  extension. and more people are planting vineyards to
sell  grapes to wineries.
fiola,  who helps the state's grape industry with research and
development,  said he gets several inquiries a week from people
interested  in getting started. some are entrepreneurs looking for a
new  venture; others are fruit farmers who want to diversify, he
said.
 many  of the newcomers want to plant in the southern part of the
state,  where the weather is perfect for the grapes that are in the
most  demand, fiola said.
most  of new jersey's wineries are in the hilly northern part of
the  state, which has cool weather and is good for growing such
grapes  as riesling and pinot noir. but the most popular grapes,
such  as cabernet sauvignon, cabernet franc, merlot and chardonnay,
require  a long, warm growing season. southern new jersey, with
moderating  winds from the delaware river, delaware bay and atlantic
ocean,  is much warmer than the north.
''i  think that'll make a big difference if we can get these
quality  grapes growing in south jersey,'' fiola said.
rather  than view the newcomers as competition, the state's
winemakers  say they welcome them.
''we've  got some exciting areas to grow grapes and a lot of
advantages  that people don't seem to be recognizing,'' said john
altmaier,  winemaker at unionville vineyards in ringoes.
altmaier,  who received the ''winemaker of the year'' award from
vineyard  and winery management magazine in 1998 and has worked in
vineyards  in germany and australia, acknowledged that the state has
a  ''reputation problem.''
''i  think that's a new jersey thing, and those things are hard
to  change,'' he said. ''but things are picking up.''
the  state's wines don't suffer image troubles in malaysia, japan
or  cuba, though. tomasello winery in hammonton exports its fruit
wines  to those countries and is working on distributing in iceland
and  europe, said marketing director lydia reese.
''our  fruit wines are made with 100 percent blueberries,
raspberries  and cranberries and have been very popular with the
asian  community,'' she said. ''one reason is they're very healthy,
with  very high antioxidants, and they have a unique flavor.''
tomasello,  which produced 38,000 cases last year, is one of the
larger  wineries in the state. most are small, family-run operations
that  don't have large marketing and distribution systems. they sell
most  of their wine at their wineries and rely on word-of-mouth,
newsletters  and wine festivals for publicity.
charles  beatty, wine director at canal's discount liquor mart in
marlton,  said new jersey wines ''can't compete with california or
french  wines'' and are viewed as more of a novelty.
''i  support the wineries because they are unique to new jersey.
you'll  never find blueberry wine anywhere else. i love them. i sell
them,''  he said, ''but how often do people drink blueberry wine?''
anthony  b. valenzano, who runs valenzano winery in shamong with
his  father and brother, said maybe people should stop comparing new
jersey  wineries to california's and should concentrate on what
grows  well here.
''california  has done a good job of convincing people that
cabernets,  chardonnays and merlots are the only good grapes, but
there  are other good grapes that make good wines,'' he said.
those  who taste new jersey wines for the first time generally
are  impressed, said altmaier.
''as  a winemaker, i'm not going to try to convince you that
they're  the greatest wines in the world. but there's not a flaw in
them.  they're nicely made. most people are surprised when they come
here.  they never knew new jersey had wines like this,'' he said.

[HEADLINE] :  hillary clinton seeks to energize black voters
[TEXT]
albany,  n.y. (ap) - hillary rodham clinton, trying to stitch
together  a coalition that will carry her to the u.s. senate, is
facing  a stiffer test in making sure blacks go the polls since new
york  city mayor rudolph giuliani left the race.
her  success at getting out the black vote could determine the
outcome  of what appears to be a very close race against her new
republican  rival, rick lazio, a congressman from long island who
has  not generated the sort of animosity within the black community
the  mayor did.
''with  giuliani in the race, there would have been an
avalanche''  of black votes for clinton, said state comptroller h.
carl  mccall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in new
york.
 ''the  difference is, we'll need a bigger effort to energize the
community,  but it will be energized on the basis of the issues that
hillary  clinton has been talking about and has been identified with
for  a long time,'' mccall, a democrat considering a run for
governor  in 2002, predicted.
but  there are some who are cautioning she must do more.
''we  all knew why we didn't want giuliani in the senate. with
giuliani  out, you've got to give us a reason to put you in the
senate,''  said the rev. al sharpton, a prominent figure in new
york's  black community, ''and i'm not sure that has been done.''
giuliani  has been heavily criticized for what critics say is a
lack  of sympathy to the needs of new york city's large minority
population  and being too supportive of a police force blacks have
viewed  as overly aggressive.
interestingly,  independent polls show that lazio, by the
numbers,  is no more a favorite with blacks than giuliani. but that
appears  more a function of clinton's popularity than anything lazio
has  done. a sept. 21 poll from marist college's institute for
public  opinion found clinton supported by 91 percent of black
voters.  a march poll from marist, taken when giuliani was still in
the  race, had her support at 87 percent among blacks.
the  mayor left the race in mid-may after learning he had
prostate  cancer.
what  the polls don't reflect is the political maxim that it is
easier  to get people to vote against something than for it.
''there  was little doubt the polarizing effect of giuliani would
have  put turnout of minorities off the charts,'' said marist
pollster  lee miringoff.
mccall  noted that the rev. jesse jackson made stops in syracuse
and  in new york city on monday and tuesday to help energize black
voters  and that san francisco mayor willie brown had also come to
help.
 ''i  am spending a good deal of my time trying to do that,''
mccall  added.
''we're  doing a lot of surrogate activity to get the drum beat
going,''  clinton campaign manager bill de blasio said.
the  first lady has also been visiting black churches - four in
queens  on sept. 17 alone and two in brooklyn the weekend before.
she  planned to visit four of them sunday in manhattan.
the  visits to the churches seemed to pay off judging by the
comments  of parishioners.
the  clintons ''were brought up the way we were brought up - to
treat  everyone fairly,'' said carol wilkins, of queens, who works
in  a housing project. ''i hope she makes it.''
''she'll  really work hard for us,'' said elsie murray, of
brooklyn,  who works for an insurance company. ''she loves people,
she's  sincere, she's not a phony.''
the  rev. henry simmons of st. albans congregational church in
queens  said clinton's visit there showed ''there's an earnest
desire  to hear from and to be with persons that are different and
whose  votes and whose support she knows she really needs.''
clinton  has also stepped up visits to minority neighborhoods and
interviews  with media outlets geared toward black and hispanic
communities,  de blasio said.
''we  are trying to insure that there are a series of elements
that  build up to the final turnout push,'' de blasio said.
she  and president clinton have courted black leaders from new
york  with overnight stays at the white house. mccall and his wife,
former  new york city deputy mayor joyce brown, stayed in the
lincoln  bedroom. the rev. floyd flake, a former congressman, and
manhattan  borough president c. virginia fields have also slept
over.
 clinton  aides are counting on the natural draw of a presidential
election,  plus phone banks and street volunteers to help offset any
falloff  in black interest because of giuliani's withdrawal.
they  are also counting on the popularity of the first lady, and
her  husband.
''the  motivational level is very high among people of color,
particularly  among women of color,'' de blasio said.
mccall  said there are plans to have president clinton ''speak to
targeted  groups in this state'' just before the election on his
wife's  behalf.
''you're  going to see president clinton in here with both
feet,''  maurice carroll, head of the quinnipiac university polling
institute,  predicted.
''the  bottom line is that people in communities of color relate
to  president clinton and if he is in the state, actively supporting
hillary,  they will duly note that and it will duly add to their
enthusiasm  for hillary,'' de blasio said.
while  de blasio and others have pointed with pride to a
get-out-the-vote  effort in 1998 in minority communities as being
instrumental  in helping elect democrats in new york, data shows
blacks  still tend to register and vote at a lower rate than whites.
while  about 17 percent of new york's voting age population is
black,  exit polling found that just 9 percent of voters in 1998
were  black.
sharpton  said that to energize black voters, clinton must speak
out  more forcefully on ''issues that resonate in our community,''
such  as racial profiling, police brutality and education.
''you  cannot be vague and nebulous and then expect a vote that
is  specific,'' he said.

[HEADLINE] :  atlantic city warehouse provides storage for pageant memorabilia
[TEXT]
atlantic  city, n.j. (ap) - when it was their turn, the
swimsuit-clad  contestants each stepped onto a giant wooden
turntable,  standing still as it turned them around for the judges
to  see.
when  the 1998 miss america pageant ended and the tv cameras went
off,  the turntable couldn't remain on the stage at convention hall.
it  had to go, but no one dared throw it out. after all, when you
stage  a live three-hour beauty pageant every year, you never know
what  props can be recycled for a future tv production number.
so  the turntable was shipped across town, to be stored amid
former  pageant stage sets, steel lighting trusses, souvenir
programs  and dozens of other pieces of not-ready-for-prime-time
equipment,  memorabilia and supplies belonging to the world's most
famous  beauty pageant.
''this  is the miss america warehouse,'' says manager bill weeks,
its  one and only employee. ''we have everything here, including the
kitchen  sink. two of them, in fact.''
the  warehouse, a nondescript two-story building made of blue
corrugated  metal, is located on kentucky avenue, about four blocks
from  convention hall.
unseen  by pageant contestants, tv viewers and news cameras, the
warehouse  becomes a hubbub of activity in the week before the
contestants  arrive here for the annual fall festivities and in the
days  after the new winner is crowned.
''with  different years, it's different things,'' said former
hostess  committee chairwoman mildred brick, 85, who led a reporter
and  photographer on a tour of the building recently.
''we  save a lot of stuff because whoever's doing the scene
designing  comes in here and sees what we have to start with. a lot
of  things get used over and over again,'' brick said.
dusty,  unmarked and barely recognizable from their appearances
on  stage, the old sets take up only a fraction of the space in the
building.
 most  of the rest is taken up by the plywood, mattresses,
mirrors,  shoe racks and assorted furniture needed to build the
pageant's  ''anchor station'' and a backstage area called ''sleepy
hollow,''  where exhausted tap dancers, pianists and baton twirlers
can  catch a few winks during rehearsals.
the  anchor station is a section of convention hall that is
converted  into the headquarters of miss america during the 12 days
between  their arrival and the telecast itself.
the  contestants sleep in casino hotel rooms and practice on
stage,  but every other activity is centered at the anchor station.
there,  they eat lunch, pose for photographs, sit for interviews
with  the press and gather before events. this is where the kitchen
sinks  come in: they are used for the food operation, which fixes
and  serves 5,000 meals to contestants, volunteers and pageant
hostesses  over the 12-day period.
the  plywood - which is stacked 15-feet high and 5-feet deep
against  a wall in the warehouse - is used to build the anchor
station  and an adjacent cluster of offices for pageant executives.
the  mattresses are kept in a climate-controlled room, to prevent
them  from mildewing. the mirrors - 55 oak-framed, 12-by-18-inch
vanity  mirrors - are covered in brown paper and stored just so, to
avoid  breakage.
''we  care for the girls from the minute they get here until the
minute  they leave. it's like setting up a whole home for them,
while  they're in atlantic city,'' brick said.
much  of what is stored in the warehouse is strictly archives. in
one  room, shelves are stacked with old copies of the miss america
program  book, a thick, glossy magazine-style publication listing
each  year's contestants, schedule of events and sponsors.
wrapped  in brown paper, labeled by winner - ''tawny godin,
1976''  - because each year's winner appears on the front cover of
the  following year's program. each package contains 100 copies of
that  year's program.
then  there are the dozen cardboard boxes packed with sheet
music,  most of it written by composer bernie wayne, the man who
penned  ''there she is,'' the song used to serenade the winner as
she  takes her runway walk.
like  any storage area, the miss america warehouse is a
hodgepodge  of old and new: walking through it, you see steel
lighting  trusses, 20-foot wooden pillars, stapled wooden risers,
gold  faux organ pipes, shoe racks and stacks of old correspondence.
''for  one or two days, we're here preparing and shipping stuff
and  then we're back here again after the pageant, because the stuff
has  to be out of convention hall,'' said brick.

[HEADLINE] :  thriller depicts n.korean soldiers
[TEXT]
seoul,  south korea (ap) -- wolves, monsters, baby-snatchers.
throughout  the cold war, the south korean government peddled
propaganda  about the denizens of its once-bitter foe, communist
north  korea.
now,  with reconciliation blooming on the korean peninsula,
southerners  are hungry to know what their old and mysterious enemy
is  really like.
they're  getting a warmer view at the cinema this month, where a
new  thriller depicts north korean soldiers as funny and vulnerable,
rather  than stereotypically cruel and inhuman.
since  it opened sept. 9, ''joint security area'' has drawn more
than  2 million viewers in a country of 47 million people and is
poised  to become south korea's biggest movie hit.
the  title of the tale about a murder investigation that
threatens  to topple the uneasy peace on the korean peninsula refers
to  the neutral border area in the demilitarized zone, or dmz. u.s.
soldiers  operate in the area, a negotiation site that has been the
scene  of confrontation and violence between the two sides on a few
rare  occasions.
dmz  jitters might wind down a notch soon. at their first-ever
talks  this week, the defense ministers of both koreas said their
soldiers  would cooperate in plans to reconnect a cross-border
railway.
 in  the movie, the lively portrayal of an illicit friendship
between  four south and north korean border guards matches the
curiosity  and yearnings of south koreans after five decades of
hostility.
 ''the  movie showed that ordinary citizens of north and south
korea  could mix together without any problem if it weren't for the
politics  and ideology that separates them,'' said kim yu-kyong, a
26-year-old  employee of an internet company.
tears  have been shed in a few theaters showing ''joint security
area,''  though far fewer than during a far more evocative, and
real-life,  event that helped humanize north koreans.
in  august, south koreans wept as they watched televised images
of  a round of anguished reunions of separated family members from
both  koreas who had not been able to meet in half a century.
the  reunions were the outcome of an unprecedented summit two
months  earlier between leaders of the koreas at which they agreed
to  work toward reunification, a goal expected to take years and
even  decades.
the  rapprochement has fueled south koreans' eagerness to learn
more  about their neighbors. books about the north are selling well,
television  stations show more programs about the north, and north
korea  studies are attracting more university students.
production  on ''joint security area'' began at a time when the
south's  attitude toward the north was softening under the aegis of
president  kim dae-jung and his policy of engaging pyongyang.
''the  north is viewed as the enemy,'' director park chan-wook
said.  ''i want to question whether that's really the right
perspective  on things.''
in  their roles as soldiers of opposing armies, his actors share
cigarettes,  arm wrestle, tell jokes and chat about girlfriends and
favorite  snacks. yet the shadow of the conflict that divided their
peninsula  at the end of world war ii is never distant, and violence
ensues.
 park's  movie departs from the dogmatic tradition of south korean
movies  in the 1960s and 1970s, when military-backed governments
urged  their citizens to trumpet the virtues of their system over
that  of the north.
last  year's homegrown hit, the spy thriller ''swiri'', injected
humanity  into inter-korean intrigue. the plot: a south korean
intelligence  agent falls in love with a north korean terrorist but
ends  up shooting her to death after discovering her true identity.
south  korea has been democratic for a decade, and filmmakers and
other  artists don't have to worry as much about violating
anti-communist  censorship laws that are no longer rigorously
enforced.
 the  penurious film industry in totalitarian north korea clings
to  its formulas.
in  a report last week, the north's foreign news outlet, kcna,
listed  movies such as ''star of korea'' and ''the sun of the
nation''  that glorify the achievements of kim il sung, the late
revered  leader and national founder.
''those  films, widely known as revolutionary ones, give the high
honor  and pride of the nation to the korean people who are
exceptionally  strong in the spirit of worshipping the leader,''
kcna  said.

the  state will start to accept applications as of monday, oct. 2,
under  the bill approved by the state legislature and gov. george
pataki  earlier this year expanding the ''epic'' drug program.
currently,  about 124,000 new yorkers age 65 and older are in
epic,  according to the state health department. advocates say that
number  should double by 2003 under the more liberal qualifying
criteria.
 the  health department estimates that so far, seniors have filled
more  than 35 million prescriptions at lower epic costs and saved
more  than $825 million.
the  expansion of the program is expected to cost the state about
$180  million a year by 2003.
the  health department distributed about 10,000 newsletters to
agencies  serving the elderly since this summer summarizing the
changes  in the epic program. all the seniors already enrolled in
epic  were also notified of the impending changes, as were the 9,300
seniors  who were denied benefits or who canceled their
participation  in the program in 2000.
the  health department also began running newspaper
advertisements  about epic's expansion last week and plans to make
brochures  available to every pharmacy in the state starting this
week.  there are also television ads about the epic expansion in the
works  to start airing in early 2001.
information  is also available over the epic toll-free
information  line, 1-800-332-3742, and the health department's web
site  at www.health.state.ny.us.
''we  believe this will be an effective approach to not only get
the  word out but to increase enrollment in the program,'' said rob
kenny,  a spokesman for the state health department.
the  new york aarp is also funding radio ads across the state
about  the epic changes as well as distributing information to
seniors  through its local chapters.
the  aarp's legislative representative in albany, bill ferris,
said  his group hopes the promotional campaign will enroll the newly
eligible  as well as the currently eligible seniors who have never
signed  up.
''we  are not near the number of people who are eligible,'' he
said.  ''so if the outreach is effective, we are hoping to see
substantial  numbers.''
it  is unclear how many new yorkers have not enrolled in epic who
can.  but ferris noted that of the 2.4 million new yorkers age 65 or
older,  12 percent or about 300,000 have incomes below the federal
poverty  level. they would all qualify under the current rules.
seniors  are fed up with high prescription drug prices and should
take  advantage of the state's program if they can, said new york
aarp  manager of advocacy fred griesback.
''when  we are talking to our members, they are absolutely
appalled  by what they are paying for drugs,'' he said. ''it is
desperation  that people feel. it's like pouring money down the
sink.''

[HEADLINE] :  gov. raps clinton-gore energy policy
[TEXT]
charleston,  w.va. (ap) -- west virginia gov. cecil underwood
criticized  the clinton-gore administration saturday for failing to
develop  a national energy policy.
the  administration needs to promote energy production from u.s.
sources  but instead ''treats american energy producers as the
enemy,''  underwood said in the republican party's weekly national
radio  address.
underwood's  remarks followed george w. bush's criticism of the
clinton  administration for putting ''our economy and the way of
life  it supports'' at risk by failing to develop a comprehensive
energy  policy.
bush  introduced a 10-year, $7.1 billion program to increase the
nation's  fuel sources.
underwood  criticized president clinton's recent decision to tap
the  nation's oil reserves because of high international prices.
the  decision was ''an ill-advised, election-year ploy to deplete
energy  reserves set aside for times of real crisis,'' underwood
said.  ''we would not be in this position if the clinton-gore team
had  done anything in the past eight years to work with energy
producers  in the united states instead of working against them.''
underwood,  who is involved in a tight re-election campaign
against  u.s. rep. bob wise, d-w.va., is a harsh critic of vice
president  al gore's push for an international global warming
treaty,  which calls for emissions cutbacks that would severely
tighten  regulatory control of coal-fired power plants.
''the  vice president's stated goals would devastate coal mining
in  my state and several states in appalachia and the mountains of
the  west,'' underwood said.
''coal  fired-power plants generate a majority of the nation's
electric  power, yet the gore approach would replace them -- i guess
with  windmills.''

[HEADLINE] :  singapore schools close after deaths
[TEXT]
singapore  (ap) -- singapore authorities on saturday ordered all
kindergartens,  child-care centers and nursery schools to close
temporarily  after three children died, possibly from a viral
infection.
 a  14-month-old girl and her 2-year-old brother died saturday,
and  authorities suspect the cause was hand, foot and mouth disease,
a  government statement said. a 2-year-boy also is believed to have
died  from the illness earlier this month.
a  government statement advised parents to ''keep their children
away  from crowded places,'' and to consult a doctor if their
children  showed such symptoms as fever, sore throat and sometimes
blistering  rashes on the hands and feet.
the  closures will be in effect for at least seven to 10 days,
pending  a review by officials, singapore environment ministry
spokeswoman  michelle tan said.
they  will affect more than 37,500 children in 557 child care
centers  and some 103,000 children in more than 400 kindergartens,
she  said.
tan  said that 363 cases of hand, foot and mouth disease have
been  reported in the wealthy southeast asian city-state of 3.2
million  people since mid-september.
the  disease is not usually life-threatening but can sometimes
involve  potentially fatal complications such as meningitis,
encephalitis  and inflammation of the heart muscles.
more  than 50 children died in taiwan during an outbreak of hand,
foot  and mouth disease in 1998. thirty died of the illness in the
malaysian  state of sarawak on borneo island in 1997.

[HEADLINE] :  hmo lawsuit bill tops legislative agenda
[TEXT]
trenton,  n.j. (ap) - legislation to enable patients to sue their
health  insurance carriers for malpractice and another bill
appropriating  $150 million for transportation projects top the
state  senate's voting session agenda for monday.
the  right-to-sue bill would allow patients to take their hmos to
court  for negligence if they can show the denial or delay of care
adversely  affected their health.
''hmos  must be held accountable for the quality health care that
new  jerseyans need and deserve, said jerry flanagan, health care
advocate  for new jersey public interest research group, which has
backed  the bill. opponents warn it will invite a flood of frivolous
lawsuits.
 the  $150 million for transportation projects represents the
second  decrease from a $500 million transportation bond issue
approved  by the voters in 1999. half the bond issue was dedicated
to  counties and municipalities for bridge repair and replacement.
the  other half goes to a variety of state transportation projects,
including  roads, bridges and bikeways.
under  the bill to be considered monday, $25 million would go to
counties  and municipalities for bridge repairs and replacements and
$125  million would go to state transportation projects. in the
previous  decrease earlier this year, counties and municipalities
got  $125 million while $80 million went to state projects.
another  bill on the senate list would appropriate $3.25 million
to  cranford to help finance the first phase of a four-phase plan of
flood  control projects. cranford was hit by severe flooding from
the  rahway river during hurricane floyd last year, suffering $15
million  in damage. it also experienced flooding in 1992, 1996 and
1997.
 volunteer  ambulance squads and fire companies might get some
protection  from overregulation under a bill that would require an
impact  statement for any proposed regulation affecting them. the
intent  is to keep from driving volunteer first aid squads and fire
companies  out of business.
instruction  on compulsive gambling would be included as part of
the  required curriculum in health and physical education under
another  senate bill scheduled for debate.
another  bill is aimed at ensuring that agreements made and
contracts  signed in cyberspace hold the same legal weight as paper
transactions.
 in  addition to considering 29 bills, the senate will hear from
former  new york democratic rep. shirley a. chisholm. chisholm, the
first  holder of the wynona m. lipman chair in women's political
leadership  at the eagleton institute of rutgers university, will
address  the senate session when it opens at 2 p.m. on monday.
the  assembly meets thursday.

[HEADLINE] :  restored fire towers offer great views and a glimpse of history
[TEXT]
hunter,  n.y. (ap) - from the top of hunter mountain, there's a
panoramic  view of the black head range to the north, the indian
head  wilderness to the east, and the spruceton valley to the west.
such  grand, 360-degree vistas are rare in the catskill
mountains,  where trees block at least part of the view from most of
the  rounded summits. but on hunter, a fire tower rising above the
balsams  lets hikers expand their horizons - if they're brave enough
to  climb 80 steep steps to a wind-buffeted, precarious perch.
the  steel structure, gleaming in the sun with a fresh coat of
silver  paint, is one of four towers recently restored to safe
climbing  condition in the catskills. restoration work is almost
finished  on a fifth.
in  the adirondacks, three renovated towers are open to the
public  and work is under way to repair several others.
restoring  the towers is a labor of love for a diverse group of
people,  most of them volunteers. they include hikers, history
buffs,  conservationists, tourism boosters, local governments, and
nonprofit  groups seeking to preserve the heritage of the mountain
regions.
 ''the  network of fire spotters had a lot to do with protecting
the  forest preserve,'' said steven engelhart, executive director of
adirondack  architectural heritage. ''it's an interesting chapter in
adirondack  history.''
''there's  a romantic appeal to fire towers,'' engelhart said.
''people  are drawn to them, much as they are drawn to
lighthouses.''
 the  state forest commissioner proposed the construction of fire
towers  throughout the catskills and adirondacks in 1909. a wooden
tower  on hunter mountain, later replaced by a steel structure, was
the  first of 13 towers built that year.
it  was an era when sparks from coal-fired trains ignited the
dead  timber left by clear-cutting loggers, causing catastrophic
forest  fires. using hand-cranked telephones, spotters were able to
relay  an early warning before the fires raged out of control.
with  the advent of aerial observation, the reforestation of
logged-over  land, and better fire prevention and control, the
towers  eventually became obsolete. state officials started phasing
them  out in the 1980s. the last fire observer retired in 1990.
many  of the towers were dismantled. others, in rickety
condition,  were closed to the public for safety reasons.
five  steel towers remain in the 300,000-acre catskill park. in
1997,  a group of volunteers formed the catskill fire tower
restoration  project to raise money and recruit workers to repair
the  towers and open them to hikers.
the  project is cosponsored by the state department of
environmental  conservation and the catskill center for conservation
and  development. local committees coordinate work parties and raise
money  through community events such as quilt raffles and square
dances,  as well as the sale of patches, t-shirts and postcards.
some  of the cabins where fire observers lived near the base of
towers  are also being restored, with plans to open them as living
museums.
 at  the hadley tower, near the southeastern edge of the
adirondack  park, and blue mountain, in the center of the
adirondacks,  summit stewards sometimes work on weekends to share
fire  tower lore and help visitors identify the peaks and lakes in
the  distance. there has also been a summit steward at the mount
arab  tower in the northern adirondacks.
leaflets  with historical and natural history information are
available  at the trailheads to hadley, blue, goodnow, and
poke-o-moonshine  mountains in the adirondacks.
''all  these preservation efforts aspire to have an interpreter
in  the tower during the summer at least,'' engelhart said.
''besides  coordinating firefighting activities, the fire observers
were  early conservation educators. they told hikers about plants,
wildlife,  what they were seeing in the landscape. interpreters can
serve  this role again.''
the  red hill fire tower is the only one in the catskills with a
formal  interpretive program, with volunteers staffing the tower and
restored  observer's cabin every weekend through october, said helen
budrock  of the catskill center.
''eventually  we hope to have interpreters at all the towers,''
budrock  said. the catskill center also is working on a web page
about  the towers, which will be accessible through the center's web
site  (www.catskillcenter.org).
in  addition to the hunter mountain tower, restored catskill fire
towers  are also open to the public on balsam lake mountain in
hardenburgh,  red hill in denning, and overlook mountain in
woodstock.  the tremper mountain tower in phoenicia is expected to
be  open by early november.
hiking  to the towers isn't terribly strenuous, since most of
them  have old jeep trails that were once used by fire observers but
now  are closed to motor vehicles.
to  get to the hunter tower, you can take a scenic chairlift ride
from  the hunter mountain ski center and then hike up two miles of
rocky  trail and old road. there are also several other trails up
the  mountain.
a  new guide book called ''views from on high: fire tower trails
of  the adirondacks and catskills'' is being published by the
adirondack  mountain club this fall.

[HEADLINE] :  india's pm expands cabinet
[TEXT]
new  delhi, india (ap) -- prime minister atal bihari vajpayee
added  six members to his cabinet including one of india's most
popular  female politicians -- just before two other ministers
resigned  to protest a hike in oil prices.
mamata  banerjee, the federal minister for railways, announced
her  resignation in the eastern city of calcutta along with her
trinamul  congress party colleague ajit kumar panja, the junior
foreign  affairs minister, united news of india reported.
banerjee  did not withdraw support from the government -- her
party  is a partner in vajpayee's ruling coalition -- and the
decision  not does immediately threaten the administration.
banerjee  was protesting the government's decision friday to
increase  prices of subsidized diesel, gasoline, kerosene and other
oil  products to make up for lost revenue from the recent rise in
global  oil prices.
if  the two resignations are accepted by ceremonial president
kocheril  raman narayanan, the cabinet would have 73 members.
narayanan  would act on the prime minister's advice.
shortly  before banerjee announced her decision, narayanan
administered  the oath of office in new delhi to sushma swaraj, a
former  federal minister, m. venkaiah naidu, a former spokesman of
vajpayee's  bharatiya janata party, and four other first-time
ministers.
 their  responsibilities were not immediately announced.
swaraj,  48, has for years been one of india's most well-known
female  politicians, and has often been assigned tough tasks by her
party,  the bharatiya janata party, in the past.
in  1999, she was asked to become the chief minister, or top
elected  official, of the delhi state government weeks before
elections  to help the fortunes of the unpopular government. months
later,  she was chosen to run against sonia gandhi, leader of the
main  opposition congress party, in a tough election battle that
swaraj  lost.
late  friday, the gasoline prices were increased by six cents per
liter.  that raises the cost of the fuel used for most cars,
scooters  and three-wheel vehicles 65 cents per liter.
diesel  and kerosene, which is used for cooking, were also hiked
six  cents per liter, while low-pressure gas, used for cooking and
heating,  was raised by 87 cents per liter.

[HEADLINE] :  8 palestinians killed in clashes
[TEXT]
jerusalem  (ap) -- thousands of palestinian rock throwers and
several  gunmen clashed with israeli troops saturday in what
palestinians  said was a religious war over a bitterly contested
jerusalem  shrine. nine palestinians, including two teen-agers, were
killed  and 325 demonstrators injured.
it  was the second day of deadly clashes in what has become the
worst  violence in the west bank and gaza strip in four years. on
friday,  six palestinians were killed and close to 200 were injured.
''the  battle for jerusalem has begun,'' said bassem naim, a
palestinian  activist.
palestinian  gunmen and israeli troops exchanged fire in two
areas,  near the jewish settlement of netzarim in gaza and south of
the  west bank town of nablus.
at  the netzarim junction, a palestinian fired shots at an
israeli  army outpost from behind a red truck. soldiers returned
fire,  and several palestinians took cover on the ground, covering
their  heads with their hands, their faces pressed on the asphalt.
one  palestinian man screamed in pain when he was shot in the knee.
paramedics  ran into the line of fire to drag him to safety.
shifa  hospital in gaza city reported three dead -- a 12-year-old
boy,  a palestinian policeman and an ambulance driver. a fourth
palestinian,  from the town of khan yunis, was comatose with a
bullet  wound to the head.
in  the west bank, six palestinians were killed by israeli fire,
including  five who died in a gun battle between a dozen masked
gunmen  and israeli troops near nablus. the gunmen crouched behind
walls  and olive trees as they aimed at the israelis who took cover
behind  jeeps.
''the  israelis must understand that palestinians can also shoot
and  kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an m-16 assault
rifle  who would not give his name.
hospital  officials initially said one of those killed in nablus
was  a 14-year-old boy. however, the victim's parents gave his age
as  16.
violence  erupted across the west bank, gaza and arab
neighborhoods  of jerusalem. huge plumes of black smoke from burning
tires  rose high above palestinian towns, and streets were littered
with  rocks and overturned garbage bins.
in  hebron, rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the
scene  in taxis. helmeted israeli soldiers fired rubber-coated steel
pellets  and live rounds from behind jeeps and walls.
palestinians  say the trigger for the violence was a visit
thursday  by israel's hawkish opposition leader, ariel sharon, to
the  disputed jerusalem hilltop known to jews as the temple mount
and  to muslims as haram as-sharif, or noble sanctuary.
in  clashes at the compound friday, six palestinians were killed
and  close to 200 wounded. ''we're going to teach them not to touch
our  holy place,'' said khalil natash, 21, a stone-thrower in the
west  bank town of hebron, who carried a black flag of mourning for
those  killed. ''we will burn the ground underneath the israelis to
stop  them from touching our holy place.''
israeli  prime minister ehud barak appealed to palestinian leader
yasser  arafat to restore calm. he said israel has been showing
''maximum  restraint,'' but would do what was necessary to protect
its  citizens and restore order. the violence erupted as israelis
marked  the jewish new year.
barak's  senior policy adviser, danny yatom, said he believed
there  was still a possibility to resume peace negotiations once the
violence  has died down. ''i really hope the peace process won't be
hurt,  but i can't be sure,'' yatom said.
israeli-palestinian  peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty  claims to the jerusalem shrine. neither side wants the
other  to have full control. all u.s. compromise proposals have been
rejected  so far by the negotiators.
palestinian  peace negotiator nabil shaath said israeli security
forces  committed ''premeditated murder'' at the jerusalem shrine
friday.  the violence underscored palestinian demands that israel
must  withdraw from east jerusalem, the sector the palestinians
claim  as a future capital, shaath said.
marwan  barghouti, the fatah leader in the west bank, said he
expected  confrontations to intensify in the coming days.
''the  way the israelis are behaving now in the palestinian
territories  and israel's reluctance to express regret over what has
been  done at the mosque is encouraging the spread of the
confrontations,''  he said.
many  israelis felt the palestinians were responsible. ''despite
the  fact that there is a peace process, they (the palestinians)
want  to ruin everything,'' said meirav buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from  the town of netanya. ''there won't be peace. there will only
be  war.''
across  the west bank, gaza strip and east jerusalem,
palestinians  observed a general strike and day of mourning
saturday.  shops were closed and children were sent home from
school.  israel barred its citizens from entering the
palestinian-controlled  areas to avoid further friction.

[HEADLINE] :  franks, corzine differ on federal government's role in public education
[TEXT]
trenton,  n.j. (ap) - in some ways, u.s. senate candidates jon
corzine  and bob franks agree on what and how children should be
taught.
 democrat  corzine and republican franks part company, however,
over  the federal government's role in public education.
both  corzine, the millionaire wall street retiree, and franks,
the  union county congressman, support ''character'' education to
promote  values in children and after-school programs to provide
them  with a safe haven, for example.
after  that, differences emerge.
corzine  has also made college scholarships a key feature of a
campaign  platform driven by television advertising, although he
recently  tempered his promises somewhat with caveats to control
runaway  costs. some took it as a signal he may shift away from the
universal  promises offered during the primary to a more measured
set  of proposals for the general election.
as  for the public schools, both candidates have laid out a
variety  of proposals on what polls suggests is a hot-button issue.
franks  believes the federal government ought to hand over more
control  to local school districts and parents.
conversely,  corzine proposes that the federal government
increase  its involvement by targeting increased funding to solve
specific  flaws in public education.
corzine  ''is not only committed to ensuring that the federal
government  plays a bigger role, but will target the funds to the
public  education system's biggest needs,'' said campaign
spokeswoman  ivette mendez.
in  new jersey, the federal government contributed 3.7 percent of
education  costs in the 1998-99 school year, the last year for which
statistics  are available, according to the new jersey school boards
association.
 among  corzine's various calls for more federal investment is a
$50  billion program over 10 years to ensure that preschool programs
are  accredited, meet health and safety standards, and supply
well-trained  and compensated staff.
overall,  corzine wants to see federal education aid increase to
enable  local districts to hire and train more certified teachers,
reduce  class sizes, enhance school safety and stem substance abuse,
mendez  said.
the  democrat supports interest-free school construction bonds
with  tax credits to help state and local governments modernize,
repair  and build public schools, mendez said.
unlike  corzine, franks wants to decentralize the federal
government's  hold on public education.
''bob  franks believes parents, teachers and administrators know
what's  best for our children. they should be the ones empowered to
make  decisions regarding our children's education, not a washington
bureaucracy,''  said campaign spokesman peter demarco.
franks  supports federal block grants to give local officials the
flexibility  to meet local needs. in return, the districts would
have  to meet higher education accountability standards, demarco
said.
 franks'  decentralized approach irks the corzine campaign, which
says  there aren't enough accountability strings attached to franks'
favored  form of aid.
corzine  also takes franks to task for voting in 1995 to
dismantle  the federal department of education, but franks' campaign
said  the resolution was merely advisory and never implemented.
''what  they cited was not binding language,'' said demarco. ''it
only  called on appropriators to consider eliminating the department
of  education.'' demarco noted the provision was a small part of a
300-page  report.
''the  goal of the report was not to reduce the financial
commitment  to education, but to have more federal money find its
way  to classrooms,'' he said.
franks  said he will press to triple federal funding for
educating  the disabled and handicapped, and he has proposed a $1
billion  loan program to help charter schools pay for new
facilities.
 franks  also voted for a bill that would allow states to
distribute  federal funds to parents who need help paying private
school  tuition. corzine opposes vouchers for private school costs.

[HEADLINE] :  clinton tries to energize black voters in absence of anti-giuliani base
[TEXT]
albany,  n.y. (ap) - hillary rodham clinton, trying to stitch
together  a coalition that will carry her to the u.s. senate, faces
a  stiffer test in making sure blacks go the polls since new york
city  mayor rudolph giuliani left the race.
her  success at mobilizing the black vote could determine the
outcome  of a close race against her new republican rival, rick
lazio,  a congressman from long island who has not generated the
sort  of animosity among blacks that the mayor did.
''with  giuliani in the race, there would have been an
avalanche''  of black votes for clinton, said state comptroller h.
carl  mccall, the only black ever elected to statewide office in new
york.
 ''the  difference is, we'll need a bigger effort to energize the
community,  but it will be energized on the basis of the issues that
hillary  clinton has been talking about,'' said mccall, a democrat
considering  a run for governor in 2002.
some  black leaders insist she must do more.
''we  all knew why we didn't want giuliani in the senate,'' said
the  rev. al sharpton, a prominent new york city activist. ''with
giuliani  out, you've got to give us a reason to put you in the
senate,  and i'm not sure that has been done.''
giuliani's  critics say the mayor lacks sympathy toward new york
city's  large minority population and has been too supportive of a
police  force that many blacks view as overly aggressive.
but  polls show that lazio is doing no better among blacks than
giuliani.  a sept. 21 poll from marist college's institute for
public  opinion found clinton supported by 91 percent of black
voters.  a marist poll in march, when giuliani was in the race, had
her  support at 87 percent among blacks.
the  mayor left the race in mid-may after learning he had
prostate  cancer. what the polls don't reflect is whether his
withdrawal  might reduce black turnout.
''there  was little doubt the polarizing effect of giuliani would
have  put turnout of minorities off the charts,'' said marist
pollster  lee miringoff.
to  energize black voters, the clinton campaign has organized
visits  by rev. jesse jackson and san francisco mayor willie brown.
the  first lady has been visiting black churches - and winning
praise  from parishioners.
the  clintons ''were brought up the way we were brought up - to
treat  everyone fairly,'' said carol wilkins of queens, who works in
a  housing project. ''i hope she makes it.''
''she'll  really work hard for us,'' said elsie murray of
brooklyn,  who works for an insurance company. ''she loves people,
she's  sincere, she's not a phony.''
clinton  has stepped up interviews with media outlets geared
toward  black and hispanic communities.
she  and president clinton also have courted black leaders from
new  york with overnight stays at the white house. mccall and his
wife,  former new york city deputy mayor joyce brown, stayed in the
lincoln  bedroom. the rev. floyd flake, a former congressman, and
manhattan  borough president c. virginia fields also slept over.
clinton  aides are counting on the natural draw of a presidential
election,  plus phone banks and street volunteers, to help offset
any  falloff in black interest because of giuliani's withdrawal.
mccall  said there are plans to have president clinton speak to
''targeted  groups'' in the state just before the election.
''the  bottom line is that people in communities of color relate
to  president clinton and if he is in the state, actively supporting
hillary,  they will duly note that and it will duly add to their
enthusiasm  for hillary,'' said clinton campaign manager bill de
blasio.
 de  blasio says a get-out-the-vote effort in minority communities
in  1998 was instrumental in helping elect democrats in new york.
but  data shows blacks tend to register and vote at a lower rate
than  whites. while about 17 percent of new york's voting age
population  is black, exit polling found that just 9 percent of
voters  in 1998 were black.
to  energize black voters, sharpton said, clinton must speak out
more  forcefully on ''issues that resonate in our community,'' such
as  racial profiling, police brutality and education.
''you  cannot be vague and nebulous and then expect a vote that
is  specific,'' he said.

[HEADLINE] :  us, eu to delay trade tax sanctions
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- the united states and the european union
reached  agreement saturday to delay imposition of a possible $4
billion  in economic sanctions against the united states in a trade
dispute  involving tax breaks for american exports.
the  deal was announced by the clinton administration, which had
been  negotiating against a midnight saturday deadline for
overhauling  u.s. tax laws to come into compliance with the adverse
ruling  from the world trade organization.
under  the procedural agreement, congress will have until nov. 1
to  pass the legislation. the eu agreed not to impose any penalties
until  a separate wto panel can rule on whether the new legislation
complies  with wto rules.
''the  united states and european union today demonstrated a
commitment  to avoid escalating trans-atlantic trade tensions and
managing  this wto trade dispute responsibly,'' u.s. trade
representative  charlene barshefsky said in a statement.
the  european commission, in a statement, said the eu ''prefers
to  avoid escalation of the dispute at this stage.''
the  dispute involves the biggest case the united states has lost
before  the geneva-based wto, which ruled that america's system of
granting  tax breaks to u.s. companies that send goods abroad did
not  comply with wto rules.
congress  faced a sunday deadline from the wto for passing new
legislation.  when it became clear that the deadline would not be
met,  the administration began negotiations with the eu in an effort
to  postpone any threatened sanctions.
deputy  treasury secretary stuart eizenstat stressed that it was
critical  that congress pass legislation before it adjourns for the
fall  campaign.
''we  cannot emphasize strongly enough how critical it is that
congress  complete action on the (foreign sales corporation) repeal
and  replacement legislation as expeditiously as possible,''
eizenstat  said in a statement.
created  to offset an eu tax rebate for its exporters, the tax
program  permits u.s. companies to reduce income taxes by 15 percent
through  export subsidiaries set up in offshore tax havens such as
barbados  and the virgin islands. microsoft, boeing and general
motors  are only a few of the 6,000 companies, with 4.8 million
workers,  that get the $4.1 billion annual tax break.
saturday's  agreement with the 15-nation eu does not involve the
substance  of the dispute; rather, it establishes the procedural
guidelines  by which both sides will abide.
it  is important, however, because it will protect the united
states  from eu trade sanctions while a wto panel rules on the
replacement  legislation sought from congress. the deal the two
sides  reached was modeled after procedures used by canada and
australia  in a wto dispute involving salmon.
the  eu contends that the changes in the export tax law under
consideration  by congress do not go far enough to meet the wto's
objections  that the tax breaks amount to an illegal trade subsidy.
despite  white house pressure -- and an overwhelming favorable
vote  in the house on the legislation -- senate democrats blocked
attempts  this week by republican leaders to bring the bill up for
debate.  the dispute centers on republican efforts to limit
amendments  and democrats' insistence on their rights to offer them.
in  some cases, senators want to change the legislation, which
would  set up a replacement system of trade tax breaks on foreign
sales  for about 6,000 u.s. corporations. the new tax breaks would
come  to $4.5 billion over 10 years.
sen.  richard bryan, d-nev., is pushing an amendment that would
deny  the tax benefit to pharmaceutical companies that sell drugs in
the  united states at vastly higher prices than overseas.
other  senators want to deny tobacco companies the benefits,
arguing  that the government should not provide tax breaks while
waging  a war against smoking. a similar effort failed in the house.
still  other lawmakers want to attach completely unrelated
measures.  sen. russell feingold, d-wis., sought a vote on a
campaign  finance reform amendment on the trade tax bill, while sen.
edward  m. kennedy, d-mass., has threatened try to attach language
raising  the $5.15-an-hour minimum wage on several pieces of
legislation.
 senate  majority leader trent lott, r-miss., expressed
frustration  at the blocking tactics after he tried to bring the tax
measure  to the floor thursday. he expressed hope that the senate
would  be able to pass the proposal ''in the next few days.''

[HEADLINE] :  search protection leads court agenda
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- difficult questions about americans'
constitutional  protection against unreasonable searches -- while in
their  homes, cars and even in hospital beds -- lead the supreme
court's  agenda as the justices begin their 2000-2001 term monday.
some  observers, however, say the most important day for the
nation's  highest court will be election day. the next president
will  choose the next members of a court that has been divided 5-4
on  some of the nation's most explosive issues.
the  court this term also is confronting a major challenge to the
nation's  premier environmental law, the clean air act, and will
decide  whether people can sue states to enforce the federal ban on
discrimination  against the disabled.
the  term that ended in june was a blockbuster. the justices
upheld  the miranda warnings police must give before questioning
criminal  suspects, let the boy scouts ban homosexual troop leaders
and  struck down a state's ''partial-birth'' abortion law.
they  also banned group prayers at public high school football
games  and prevented rape victims from suing their attackers in
federal  courts.
the  court last week cleared its plate of the massive microsoft
antitrust  dispute by sending it to a federal appeals court,
delaying  a final ruling perhaps for years.
the  47 cases granted review for the new term -- with about two
dozen  more to be added in coming months -- lack the political punch
of  last year's cases but still will touch the lives of many
ordinary  americans.
''it's  already looming as a big year for the fourth amendment,''
which  protects americans against unreasonable searches and arrests,
said  steven shapiro of the american civil liberties union.
a  case that could affect the nation's 185 million licensed
drivers  asks whether police can arrest people for traffic
violations  punishable only by a fine. a texas woman, whose lawyers
call  her a ''typical motorist,'' says police went too far when they
arrested,  handcuffed and jailed her because she and her children
were  not wearing seatbelts in the family pickup truck.
other  cases illustrate ''the pressure that the war on drugs has
exerted  on the fourth amendment in particular and the constitution
in  general,'' shapiro said.
the  justices will decide whether police can set up traffic
checkpoints  and stop motorists in hopes of catching people who sell
or  use illegal drugs.
police  generally need a warrant or a reason to suspect someone
of  a crime before detaining them for several minutes, and a lower
court  ruled that drug checkpoints by indianapolis police likely
amounted  to unreasonable seizures. but the supreme court previously
has  upheld roadblocks aimed at catching drunken drivers.
another  war-on-drugs case asks whether public hospitals can test
pregnant  patients for drug use and tell police who tested positive.
a  south carolina hospital tested patients' urine without a court
warrant,  and if the result were positive, women were arrested for
endangering  the fetus.
a  group of women sued but a federal appeals court upheld the
tests,  saying hospitals had a ''substantial interest'' in seeking
to  reduce cocaine use by pregnant women.
a  case that was among a dozen granted review last week, when the
justices  got a head start on their new term, asks whether police
need  a search warrant to use a device to detect heat coming from
someone's  home. an oregon man was charged with growing marijuana
after  police said a heat-detecting device showed an unusual amount
of  heat coming from the roof over his garage.
still  another marijuana-search case involves an illinois man who
was  prevented by police from going inside his home alone until the
officers  could get a warrant to search for the drug.
the  clean air act dispute could yield a hugely important ruling
on  environmental protection that might also limit other federal
agencies'  authority to write rules to implement laws passed by
congress.
 industry  groups want the environmental protection agency to
consider  costs, in addition to health benefits, in setting federal
air-quality  standards. the case began as a dispute over the epa's
1997  standards for reducing smog and soot.
''the  argument is not that we want to turn back the clock'' on
environmental  protection, said edward warren, a lawyer for the u.s.
chamber  of commerce. instead, he said the issue is ''how are we
going  to do the most with what we have in solving environmental
problems?''
 but  frank o'donnell of the clean air trust called the
air-quality  standards ''the heart and lungs of the clean air act''
and  said a supreme court win for industry would mean ''more
pollution,  more health damage for all of us.''
the  justices might use the disability-bias case to forge ahead
with  what some legal scholars call a states' rights revolution -- a
series  of rulings that have sharply tipped the federal-state
balance  of governmental power toward the states. in january the
court  ruled that state employees cannot go into federal court to
sue  over age bias.
now,  the justices have agreed to decide whether state employees
can  sue in federal court to enforce the 1990 americans with
disabilities  act, a law that aims to protect the disabled against
job  bias. the law is perhaps best known for requiring wheelchair
ramps  in buildings across the country.
the  court's decision could sweep broadly enough to affect all
ada  lawsuits filed against state governments, not just those filed
by  state employees.

[HEADLINE] :  german unification was unstoppable
[TEXT]
london  (ap) -- german unification seemed unthinkable when the
berlin  wall unexpectedly opened on nov. 9, 1989. before christmas
it  began to look inevitable.
just  19 days after jubilant crowds first poured through
checkpoint  charlie, while his allies were urging caution in dealing
with  the rapidly unfolding drama, chancellor helmut kohl offered a
plan  to tie east germany and west germany into one nation. by dec.
9,  european union leaders reaffirmed germany's right to
unification.  ten months later it happened.
ten  years after german reunification, the berlin wall and the
country  called east germany have vanished, and europe is just as
stable  and peaceful as before.
but  at the time, there were fears in many capitals that
reunification  could disrupt the balance of power and provoke a
soviet  response, and there were long memories of two world wars.
what  couldn't be known at the time was how weak moscow was, and the
extent  to which chancellor helmut kohl had correctly judged the
hunger  for union in both parts of germany.
''before  1989 i can remember in our discussions nobody spoke
about  the possibility of germany reunification,'' wilfried martens,
prime  minister of belgium from 1979 to 1992, recalled in an
interview  with the associated press in brussels.
instantly,  the issue became pressing business.
martens  recalled that italian premier giulio andreotti expressed
some  doubts, but that the most vociferous opponent of german
unification  was british prime minister margaret thatcher. and
thatcher  found french president francois mitterrand ''still more
concerned  than i was.''
thatcher  thought she had an ally in mitterrand, and they had two
private  meetings during a european union summit in december.
''he  observed that in history the germans were a people in
constant  movement and flux. at this i produced from my handbag a
map  showing the various configurations of germany in the past,
which  were not altogether reassuring about the future. we talked
through  what precisely we might do,'' thatcher wrote in ''the
downing  street years,'' her 1993 memoirs.
mitterrand,  in her view, decided to do nothing, and that dashed
her  hopes of slowing kohl's rapid moves.
guy  cabanel, a conservative member of the french senate,
recalled  his own misgivings at the time.
''there  were two fears: the existential fear of germany of the
french  people and that the reunification would happen in disorder
and  that it would lead to unrest in what was then the ussr,
provoking  military troubles,'' said cabanel.
''i  was more leaning in favor of a harmoniously negotiated
reunification,  and of avoiding as much as possible the presence of
the  crowd,'' cabanel said. ''there was also the fear that germany
would  lose interest in european construction, to concentrate its
efforts  on reunification.''
thatcher,  then fighting moves to draw britain deeper into the
european  political and economic ambit, feared the reverse -- that to
gain  unification, kohl would accept tying germany into an
ever-closer  european union. the momentum toward a single germany
accelerated  in february 1990, when soviet leader mikhail gorbachev
signaled  his acceptance by saying, ''the unity of the german nation
must  be decided by the germans themselves.''
on  march 18, the newly formed alliance for germany, a
pro-unification  party, won 48 percent of the vote in east germany's
first  free election.
six  days later, thatcher met prominent academics at chequers,
her  official country residence, to ponder whether german
unification  was a good idea, and whether it could be stopped.
the  men she invited didn't share her fears.
''we  were extremely respectful towards present-day germany,''
oxford  university historian norman stone wrote years later.
thatcher  shocked some of the academics with her antagonism
toward  germany and germans.
''as  we were leaving i remarked to an english colleague that the
only  word she refrained from using in connection with germany was
'huns,'''  fritz stern of columbia university in new york later
recalled.
 by  that time, stern said, the die was cast.
''when  we met at chequers, the point had already been reached
where  east germany was bankrupt. the wall had been breached. it was
evident  that a majority in the gdr (german democratic republic)
favored  unification,'' stern said in an interview last year with
the  swiss newspaper neue zuercher zeitung.
''the  only ones who could have prevented it back then were the
russians,''  stern said.
swedish  journalist per landin, author of ''last tango in the
ddr,''  a 1991 book about the demise of east germany, was critical
of  reunification at the time.
''i  thought it went too fast,'' he said in an interview. ''it
wasn't  really a reunification as much as an annexation to or an
enlargement  of west germany.''
he  has changed his mind. ''it's been better than i had expected,
even  though it is an awesome mental change that will take several
generations''  to complete, he said.
belgium's  martens believes the doubters have been proved wrong.
in  the former east germany and east berlin, ''the changes are
incredible,  the investments were amazing in the infrastructure, the
modernization.  when we see berlin now it's not just a renovation,
it's  been a real revolution.''
''of  course there are still social and psychological problems.
the  integration is still going on. they have unified, but they
still  have to be integrated,'' martens said.
thatcher  concluded that she had been right to oppose rapid
unification,  but wrong to think she could do anything to stop it.
''most  observers were unaware of the nationalist passion for
german  unity that burned in the east,'' thatcher wrote.
''in  the event,'' thatcher said, ''the desire for unity among
germans  on both sides of the elbe proved irresistible.''

[HEADLINE] :  budget fight shows gop changes
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- this year's budget fight, with both parties
bidding  up federal spending to record levels, underlines the stark
change  in republican rhetoric and action since the newt
gingrich-led  gop began controlling congress in 1995.
the  new budget year that began sunday finds republican leaders
emphasizing  that they would use annual federal surpluses first to
reduce  the national debt, then to cut taxes and -- yes -- increase
spending  for schools and other priorities.
clearly,  they prefer less spending than president clinton wants.
even  so, with the white house and both chambers of congress at
stake  in next month's elections, flexible gop negotiators have
accepted  administration demands for billions of extra dollars. they
have  also added plenty of additional spending on their own.
''we're  trying to address some of the additional needs the white
house  has requested,'' senate majority leader trent lott, r-miss.,
said  of budget talks. but, he added, ''i'm hoping that the feeding
frenzy  will stop.''
contrast  that with the atmosphere five years ago. republicans
had  just captured majorities of the house and senate for the first
time  in four decades, led by gingrich, r-ga., their aggressive
speaker.
 back  then, with huge federal deficits envisioned perpetually
into  the future, republicans spoke of dramatically changing the
face  of government by eliminating the annual shortfalls by 2002 and
cutting  spending and taxes. rather than negotiate, they were
unhesitant  about using brinksmanship to force clinton into
unconditional  surrender.
''it  is possible the fundamental functions of the federal
government  could close,'' one gop leader, house budget committee
chairman  john kasich of ohio, said in july 1995. ''but that is an
opportunity,  not a risk. it gets us to the point where people
decide  where we're going to go.''
by  the following january, there had been two federal shutdowns
totaling  27 days. polls showed that an angry public blamed the gop
by  about 2-to-1 for the shutdowns; ever since, republicans have
taken  a softer tone on the budget.
in  gingrich's placed is the gentler-seeming dennis hastert of
illinois  as speaker. and beyond that, not only the rhetoric has
changed.
 by  the end of fiscal 1995, the last year for which a democratic
congress  wrote a budget, discretionary spending was $546 billion,
including  cuts republicans made by year's end. discretionary
spending  is the one-third of the federal budget that congress must
approve  each year, covering everything the government does except
for  automatic payments such as social security benefits.
republicans  lopped $9 billion off that total the following year
to  $535 billion. but beginning in 1997, the figure has headed
steadily  upward, practically soaring recently amid annual, year-end
talks  in which gop fear of another shutdown has given clinton most
of  the leverage.
according  to senate budget committee estimates, discretionary
spending  reached $617 billion in 2000, a 7.3 percent increase from
the  previous year. and this year's total is so far estimated at
$646  billion, a 4.7 percent increase -- with only two of the 13
annual  spending bills for 2001 enacted. that figure is expect to
rise  as the remaining bills take their final form.
''we  have a surplus now, we had a deficit then,'' said michele
davis,  spokeswoman for house majority leader dick armey, r-texas,
explaining  the spending turnaround.
republicans  say the extra spending is possible because of
today's  huge surpluses, which have so far gone mostly to reducing
the  $3.4 trillion publicly held national debt. in a radio address
last  weekend, lott said that still leaves money to boost ''our
national  priorities such as education, defense and health
research.''
 five  years ago, gop leaders were emphasizing eliminating entire
cabinet-level  departments, not increasing spending.
further  underscoring the party's turnaround, it was republican
senators  -- including lott and sen. frank murkowski, r-alaska -- who
delayed  completion of talks last week on a new land conservation
program  by demanding extra money for coastal states.
and  when bargainers shook hands on the new program and the
administration  hailed it as a triumph, it was murkowski who issued
a  written statement complaining that ''none of the accounts might
ever  be'' spent at all.
budget  negotiations are likely to last into mid-october, with
the  government kept functioning with a series of temporary spending
bills.

[TEXT]
discretionary  spending is the portion of the federal budget --
now  at $1.8 trillion -- that congress must approve annually,
covering  everything except automatic payments such as medicare
benefits  and interest on the national debt.
fiscal  1995 was the last year spending decisions were made by a
congress  controlled by democrats. late in that fiscal year, after
republicans  took over congress, they enacted a $16 billion cut in
planned  spending.
fiscal  2001 began on sunday. fiscal 1995 through 1999 figures
are  from the congressional budget office; 2000 and 2001 estimates
are  from the senate budget committee.
1995:  $546 billion, 0.3 percent increase.
1996:  $535 billion, 2 percent decrease.
1997:  $549 billion, 2.6 percent increase.
1998:  $555 billion, 1.1 percent increase.
1999:  $575 billion, 3.6 percent increase.
2000:  $617 billion (estimate), 7.3 percent increase.
2001:  $646 billion (estimate), 4.7 percent increase, price tag
expected  to rise as final bills are negotiated.

[HEADLINE] :  more greek ferry victims found
[TEXT]
paros,  greece (ap) -- criticism of the government grew as divers
on  saturday found two more bodies inside a ferry that crashed into
rocky  islets and sank, raising the death toll to 76 in the nation's
worst  ferry disaster in 35 years.
marine  officials said the number of dead could rise further.
''doesn't  anyone have the decency to resign?'' asked
conservative  opposition leader costas caramanlis.
the  bodies were found inside the 345-foot express samina, which
sank  in rough seas two miles off the island's coast on sept. 26
after  crashing into the islets marked with a light beacon.
five  people were officially listed as missing -- four greeks and
one  albanian man, the merchant marine ministry said.
continued  confusion over the number and identity of passengers
on  the ferry has brought strong criticism of the government and
ship's  operator, minoan flying dolphins.
the  age of the fleet also has come under scrutiny, and the
government  has been criticized for what is seen as a feeble rescue
attempt  in which so many died even though the ferry sunk two miles
from  the shore. most of the criticism has come from the opposition
and  relatives of survivors.
the  ferry's captain, vassilis yannakis, his first officer and
two  other crew members will testify sunday before an investigating
magistrate  on the nearby island of syros, the region's
administrative  capital.
they  have been charged with murder, neglect of duty and
violation  of maritime procedures.
yannakis  has told investigators he was taking a nap and his
first  officer was off the bridge flirting with a passenger,
according  to testimony carried in the daily ta nea on friday.
six-member  diving teams were carrying out the search. measures
were  also being taken to prevent leakage of the 162 tons of fuel
oil  and diesel from the ship.
the  merchant marine ministry said 67 of the dead had been
identified.  they include a norwegian citizen and two canadians of
greek  descent.
the  european commission asked the greek government to provide
details  of the accident to determine whether eu safety regulations
were  violated.
''we  have asked greek authorities to provide answers within one
month,''  eu commission spokesman gilles gantelet said in brussels
on  saturday.
greek  merchant marine minister christos papoutsis, facing calls
from  critics to resign, said all passenger ferry companies would
have  to submit their safety records to the ministry by sunday or
have  vessels impounded.
more  than 10 million people travel on passenger and ferry boats
around  greece every year. there are about 18 ships over 29 years of
age  in greece's coastal fleet of about 130 ferries, many on routes
to  islands such as paros.

[HEADLINE] :  cops seek to block falun gong protest
[TEXT]
beijing  (ap) -- police checked vehicles entering china's capital
to  thwart a threatened protest by followers of the outlawed falun
gong  spiritual movement on sunday, the 51st anniversary of
communist  rule, a rights group reported.
spot  checks on major roads around beijing began friday and
continued  saturday after two weeks of police sweeps that saw 600
falun  gong members detained in nearby provinces, the hong
kong-based  information center of human rights and democracy
reported.
 the  report follows signs of government nervousness and
dispatches  in hong kong media that 10,000 sect followers were
heading  for beijing.
a  letter from ''all china's falun gong students'' recently
posted  on the group's u.s. web site warned of protests if police
stepped  up detentions ahead of the national day holiday.
china's  cabinet, the state council, issued a directive, carried
in  state-run newspapers saturday, ordering government offices to
tighten  security over the weeklong holiday.
the  order focused on general safety and demanded particular
attention  be paid to explosives.
although  falun gong members have kept their protests against the
communist  government's ban on the group peaceful, other disaffected
groups  have not.
turkic  muslims in china's central asian territory of xinjiang
have  waged a sporadic bombing campaign against chinese rule and
three  years ago bombed a bus in beijing.
national  day is china's most public holiday for celebrating the
communist  party's takeover on oct. 1, 1949.
chinese  president jiang zemin and other members of the communist
and  government elite gathered on the holiday's eve for a reception
in  the great hall of the people, next to tiananmen square.
premier  zhu rongji, in the traditional national day address,
made  only a vague, passing reference to worries of unrest by
unemployed  workers, poor farmers and falun gong members.
he  referred to ''difficulties of one kind or another in our way
ahead''  to a prosperous future.
people's  daily was more blunt. in an editorial to be published
sunday,  the party's flagship newspaper urged chinese to rally
around  the leadership to safeguard hard-won economic gains.
''stability  is the guarantor of reform and development,'' it
said.
 uniformed  and plainclothes police in the large numbers usual for
a  holiday kept careful watch on tiananmen.
chinese  by the thousands flooded into the broad square to admire
colorfully  lit fountains, floral displays and a 30-foot-tall
sculpture  of beijing's 2008 olympic bid logo.
chinese  leaders banned falun gong 14 months ago as a threat to
communist  rule and as a public menace that cheated followers and
caused  1,500 deaths. followers, however, maintain the group's
slow-motion  exercises, taoist and buddhist cosmology and the
teachings  of founder li hongzhi promote health and morality.
while  the hong kong-based rights group's report could not be
immediately  confirmed, the actions it describes fit previous police
sweeps  ahead of sensitive anniversaries. police have previously set
up  checkpoints and ordered provincial governments to round up falun
gong  members to keep them out of beijing.
another  group, new york-based human rights in china, said police
in  beijing have over the past few weeks evicted rural migrants,
street  children, beggars and others from the city as part of an
annual  clean-up campaign.
also  on saturday, french foreign ministry official jean
felix-paginon  said that china plans to revise, but not abolish its
greatly  abused system allowing police to send criminal suspects to
forced  labor camps without trial.
felix-paginon  led a european union delegation that met with
chinese  officials in beijing on friday as part of a twice-yearly
eu-china  human rights dialogue.
reform  of labor-camp detentions aside, china offered scant other
evidence  of progress on human rights in a one-day grilling, he
said.

[HEADLINE] :  florida man charged with killing 3-year-old connecticut boy
[TEXT]
	  hartford, conn. (ap) - a man who was granted temporary custody
of  a 3-year-old connecticut boy with cerebral palsy is accused of
killing  the boy at his florida home.
james  curtis, 25, was charged with first-degree felony murder
friday  in the death of alex charles boucher, who was on a visit to
the  curtis home.
on  sept. 25, curtis was watching the child and became angry when
the  boy soiled himself, authorities said.
police  said curtis scolded the boy, grabbing his cheeks hard
enough  to leave bruises, and later wrapped alex tightly in a blue
cotton  blanket and put him to bed unattended.
the  blanket was wrapped ''in a manner to willfully torture the
victim,''  according to the arrest warrant.
cpl.  jackie pehote of the police department in new port richey,
fla.,  said curtis admitted to wrapping the blanket so tightly
around  the child's body that it pinned his arms to his sides.
curtis  also said he placed the blanket just under alex's bottom lip
to  keep him from crying, authorities said.
curtis  returned to the bedroom about 30 minutes later to free
the  child because his wife, jennifer, was due home from the store,
pehote  said, but alex was unresponsive.
''he  had turned over on his stomach and choked himself,'' pehote
said.  vomit was coming from the boy's mouth.
alex,  who had cerebral palsy and other medical problems, was
placed  on life support at all children's hospital in st.
petersburg,  fla. and died wednesday. an autopsy found the cause of
death  to be homicidal asphyxia.
the  connecticut department of children and families, which had
assigned  temporary custody of alex to james and jennifer curtis for
the  september visit, had permanent custody of the child and had
been  trying to find him an adoptive home for most of his short
life.
 the  custodial rights of alex's parents had been terminated when
alex  was only a few months old because they were unable to care for
him,  dcf spokesman gary kleeblatt said.
dcf  initially placed alex with relatives in maine, thinking that
they  eventually would adopt him, but no one was able to adequately
care  for him because of his medical problems, kleeblatt said.
although  both maine and connecticut authorities attempted to
find  alex an adoptive home in those states, those efforts failed.
then  the curtises turned up.
the  young couple were former maine residents who had known
alex's  relatives and occasionally had baby-sat the child. since
moving  to florida, the couple had gone to a private child-placement
agency  in the hope of adopting. that's when they came to dcf's
attention.
 ''we  contacted that agency in florida and found that the family
had  already started the process,'' kleeblatt said. ''the agency
said  they had done a criminal record and child-protection check on
the  couple, and we received a letter from the agency saying this
would  be an appropriate placement.''
dcf  did not conduct its own background checks, kleeblatt said,
but  didn't simply turn alex over to the curtises, either. first the
couple  traveled to maine in early september and spent time with the
child  during two weeks of supervised visitation sessions.
child  protection workers from connecticut and maine thought
those  visits went well, kleeblatt said, and arrangements were made
for  alex to spend extended time in florida with the couple.
alex,  described by neighbors as a pudgy little boy with blond
hair  and a pug nose, had been living in the couple's apartment for
only  a week.
''we  are all very saddened by this,'' dcf deputy thomas gilman
said.  ''our preliminary investigation indicates that the (dcf)
worker  spent a considerable amount of time with the youngster.''
state  child advocate jeanne milstein, who was notified friday
about  the death, said her office will be investigating. milstein
said  she is going to recommend that the state child fatality review
panel,  of which she is chairwoman, also review the boy's death.

[HEADLINE] :  bc-nj--fossil auction,260
[TEXT]
	  hackensack, n.j. (ap) - one of a trio of teen-age fossil hunters
who  found a previously unknown gliding reptile 40 years ago is
suing  another in the group in a dispute over the $167,500 the
fossil  fetched at auction.
michael  brandrowski, 55, of cliffside park, filed a lawsuit last
week  in superior court in hackensack against alfred siefker, 56, of
north  bergen.
brandrowski  claims that he discovered the 200 million-year-old
fossil,  is the rightful owner and that the money it fetched at
auction  belongs to him.
the  discovery of icarosaurus siefkeri in the former granton
quarry  in 1960 led scientists to revise the evolutionary timeline.
the  reptile - with a 10-inch wingspan and 7-inch-long body - proved
that  vertebrates were flying millions of years earlier than
previously  thought.
it  had been studied for more than 30 years at the american
museum  of natural history before siefker put it up for sale. the
california  businessman who bought it returned it there tuesday, and
it  will go on display next week.
the  lawsuit claims siefker ''wrongfully took possession'' of the
fossil  in 1989 and had no right to put it up for auction aug. 27.
siefker's  attorney, robert avery, said not only did the deadline
for  brandrowski to claim ownership of the fossil pass 30 years ago,
but  his client has documentation that proves brandrowski gave up
his  rights to it and was compensated.
siefker  has said he traded brandrowski a telescope, $30 and some
fossils  for the relic.

[HEADLINE] :  japan remembers nuclear accident
[TEXT]
tokyo,  japan (ap) -- anti-nuclear activists, some dressed in
funeral  black, called for an end to nuclear energy in a noisy
demonstration  saturday, a year after japan's worst nuclear accident
killed  two people and exposed hundreds to radiation.
more  than 100 demonstrators shouted through bullhorns outside
the  science and technology agency, demanding the government pull
the  plug on japan's nuclear power industry.
nuclear  power generates about a third of electricity in this
resource-poor  country.
the  protest commemorated the sept. 30, 1999, accident at the jco
co.  fuel-reprocessing plant in tokaimura, near tokyo, in which two
workers  tried to save time by mixing excessive amounts of uranium
in  buckets instead of using special mechanized tanks.
the  mix set off an uncontrolled nuclear reaction at the plant,
exposing  the two to fatal doses of radiation. a third worker was
hospitalized  in critical condition.
authorities  ordered 161 people evacuated from their homes, and
another  310,000 were advised to stay indoors for 18 hours as a
precaution.  in all, 439 people were exposed to radiation.
the  tokaimura calamity confirmed the worst fears of the
industry's  many critics, uncovering systematic disregard for safety
regulations  and inadequate employee training.
''the  government doesn't seem to have learned anything at all
from  the accident,'' said shin kobuchi, a 22-year-old university
student.  ''it has made no effort to listen to what the experts are
saying  about the dangers of nuclear energy.''
tokaimura,  a rural community 70 miles northeast of tokyo, is
home  to a nuclear reactor and a dozen related facilities.
the  town and plant operators commemorated the first anniversary
of  the accident with a morning of disaster-prevention drills.
this  time it was make-believe.
municipal  officials rushed to a command post after receiving a
report  of a dangerous radiation leak. sirens wailed. buses shuttled
evacuees  to safe areas, where they were examined by medical
personnel  with geiger counters.
last  year's tragedy continued to weigh heavily on a nation
suspicious  of nuclear energy and increasingly aware of its
destructive  potential.
utilities  are scaling down plans to build new plants. the
government  is struggling to balance its long-term goal of expanding
nuclear  energy with calls for tightening safety measures.
in  february, a state governor in western japan forced a utility
company  to tear up blueprints for a nuclear facility, citing safety
concerns  raised by tokaimura.
a  leading japanese newspaper on saturday criticized the
government's  subsequent efforts to strengthen its supervision as
halfhearted,  asserting the industry still lacks a vigilant
watchdog.
 ''safety  should not be left to chance,'' the daily asahi wrote
in  an editorial.
jco  was stripped of its license to operate the processing plant
in  march, and the last of the remaining uranium was being removed
from  the facility this week.
the  company also has agreed to pay out $117 million in
compensation  to settle 6,875 cases stemming from the accident.

[HEADLINE] :  billionaire financier carl icahn pulls sands out of bankruptcy
[TEXT]
	  atlantic city, n.j. (ap) - billionaire financier carl icahn has
pulled  the sands casino and hotel out of bankruptcy officially by
wiring  $65 million to the casino.
icahn  assumed control of the financially struggling casino
friday,  ending its 33 months under bankruptcy protection. he owns
65  percent of the casino and has installed its board of directors.
the  state casino control commission approved icahn's takeover
plan  earlier this month to invest $65 million in cash and issue
$110  million in new bonds to prop up the casino, which has remained
operating  while reorganizing in bankruptcy.
''it's  been unsettling because there was no firm floor you're
walking  on. this is a real opportunity for the sands to have a
financial  position where it can move forward,'' sands chief
executive  officer alfred luciani told the press of atlantic city
for  saturday's editions.
the  casino had been under chapter 11 since january 1998.
icahn's  plans are already being carried out at the casino,
including  looser slot machines, construction of a 282-room hotel
tower,  a new bus terminal, casino expansion and renovations.
sands  is expected to pay another $5.4 million to vendors who
haven't  been paid for services and goods rendered before the
bankruptcy  filing. the amount is 80 percent payback on the $6.7
million  they're owed.
the  casino is now a stand-alone company called gb holdings inc.
the  small 532-room off-boardwalk casino, which occupies the
middle  of a block, has always struggled in the shadow of bally's
park  place casino resort and other bigger competitors.
it  reported losses of more than $35 million annually for the
three  years prior to the bankruptcy filing.

[HEADLINE] :  last inmates leave belfast prison
[TEXT]
belfast,  northern ireland (ap) -- the last four inmates have left
the  maze prison, which is due to be shut down as part of northern
ireland's  peace process.
''it's  an end of an era and i hope we never return to the same
circumstances  that we have had these last 30 years,'' prison
officers'  association spokesman finlay spratt said saturday.
''i  don't think a lot of people will be sad to see the close of
the  maze. it's been a blight on our life for many years and it is
good  to see the end of it,'' spratt said in an interview on british
broadcasting  corp. radio.
the  last three protestant ''loyalist'' prisoners were
transferred  to maghaberry prison west of belfast, and the lone
republican  prisoner was moved to magilligan jail in county
londonderry  on friday. seven other prisoners were moved on
thursday.
 the  good friday agreement provided for early releases for
prisoners  affiliated with groups which declared cease-fires,
including  the irish republican army on the irish catholic side, and
the  ulster defense association and ulster volunteer force on the
british  protestant side.
built  in 1976, the maze had eight h-shaped blocks designed for a
total  of 800 prisoners. the prison is southwest of belfast, near
the  protestant village of maze.
almost  from the day the maze opened, ira convicts refused to
wear  their new prison uniforms and smeared excrement on their cell
walls,  while on the outside the ira assassinated prison officers.
the  campaign reached its climax in 1981, when 10 prisoners starved
themselves  to death.
two  years later, 38 ira prisoners escaped, the biggest in
british  penal history.

[HEADLINE] :  republican lazio facing battle in conservative upstate new york
[TEXT]
buffalo,  n.y. (ap) - republican rick lazio, facing hillary
rodham  clinton in the nation's highest profile u.s. senate race,
has  found himself in a late-in-the-campaign dogfight for
traditionally  more conservative upstate new york.
lazio  kicked off a three-day bus tour through the upstate area
on  thursday, beginning with a speech to a rotary club luncheon in
buffalo.  a day earlier, the quinnipiac university polling institute
had  come out with a poll showing the first lady leading the
congressman  from long island, 50 percent to 43 percent, among
likely  voters.
while  clinton hitting the magic 50 percent mark for the first
time  this year in a major statewide independent poll dominated the
news  coverage, there was an ominous message in the poll for lazio -
the  mood of the upstate electorate. the poll found lazio supported
by  46 percent of upstate voters while clinton was backed by 44
percent,  a statistical tie given the poll's margin of error of plus
or  minus 3 percentage points.
''the  upstate stuff shouldn't be that close'' if lazio is to
win,  said maurice carroll, director of the polling institute.
buried  inside the poll was the evidence of lazio's upstate
problem.
 -thirty-eight  percent of upstate voters said they had a
favorable  opinion of clinton to 35 percent for lazio.
-when  asked if the candidates share their views on the issues,
58  percent of upstate voters said clinton did, the same number that
said  lazio did.
-asked  if the candidates had ''the stature to be a distinguished
united  states senator,'' 65 percent of upstate voters said clinton
did.  lazio hit 67 percent.
-asked  if the candidates were too liberal, too conservative or
just  about right, 53 percent of upstate voters said lazio was just
about  right while 47 percent of them said clinton was just about
right,  a very small edge for lazio.
-lazio  did have the edge, 74 percent to 45 percent, when it came
to  which candidate upstate voters felt had ''the right kind of
experience''  to be a senator from new york. he has made much of the
fact  that she only moved to new york in january.
-on  the issues, upstate voters gave the edge to clinton on
health  care, education and abortion. lazio had the edge on taxes.
-by  a 67 percent to 29 percent margin, upstate voters said a
candidate's  position on issues was more important than their
experience  or personal qualities.
that  last could be a major problem for lazio given that his
advertising  campaign has been geared to telling voters that they
can't  trust clinton. the poll found that upstate voters, like those
elsewhere  in the state, care more about where she and he stand on
the  issues.
the  upstate region, less of a sure thing for republican
candidates  running statewide than it used to be, has become
critical  in this year's senate race. in general elections, the
region  normally provides about 45 percent of the statewide vote.
asked  thursday in buffalo why he wasn't doing better in upstate
new  york, lazio said he thought he was doing just fine.
''i  don't pay attention to polls,'' he told reporters. ''if you
travel  with us and you see the crowds and the enthusiasm ... i
think  we're doing very well.''
asked  about the same thing at a later stop in rochester, lazio
said,  ''i don't believe for a moment that we are up by only two
points  in upstate. if you've been traveling around with me, as i
have  been going around upstate, people are exceedingly
supportive.''
 in  fact, clinton is generally greeted by larger crowds across
upstate  new york, certainly a reflection in part of her celebrity,
but  they also often seem more enthusiastic than those who come out
to  see lazio. she has been spending a good portion of her time in
upstate  new york.
to  counter that, the lazio campaign plans to have him spend more
time  in the upstate region in the last month of the campaign and to
spend  more money on television advertising there.
most  polls have shown clinton well ahead of lazio in heavily
democratic  new york city, which traditionally provides about 30
percent  of the statewide vote, with him having the edge in the
suburban  counties, which usually account for about a quarter of the
vote.
 that  has been the pattern for months, explaining why there is
the  heavy interest in upstate new york.
in  1998, then-republican sen. alfonse d'amato captured 55
percent  of the upstate vote to democrat charles schumer's 45
percent.  schumer won the election.
marc  humbert has covered new york state politics for the
associated  press for more than 20 years.

[HEADLINE] :  handouts vs. works in brazil race
[TEXT]
jaborandi,  brazil (ap) -- mayor jose dias da silva thought his
record  would speak for itself. surely investments in schools and
hospitals  would sway voters more than beer or food baskets at
election  time, he reasoned.
the  problem was many residents seemed to prefer the handouts.
many  here complain da silva -- known by his nickname regente --
has  spent too much on public works and not enough on the favors and
gifts  that are a hallowed campaign tradition and give the election
a  carnival feel.
that's  where his rival, lidio dias, excels.
''regente  did stuff for the city, he didn't do anything for the
poor,''  says 19-year-old lesio villas boas da franca, who wore a
dias  t-shirt.
''unfortunately  the people around here are a bit backwards,''
explains  high school principal neusa campos de oliveira. ''they
like  a guy who gives them a slap on the back. lidio was the kind of
guy  who showed up at a bar and picked up the tab for everybody. a
lot  of people owe him.''
the  campaign ahead of sunday's municipal election in this town
of  10,000 people highlights the obstacles to rooting out the
patronage  and cronyism ingrained in brazilian politics.
dias,  an old-school politician and da silva's uncle, was mayor
until  1996. when his term ended, he used his popularity and
influence  to help elect his cool, businesslike nephew.
da  silva, who attended veterinary school and served in the army,
brought  something new to jaborandi, a poor town of mostly
subsistence  farmers 375 miles northeast of brasilia.
he  went after federal funds that dias had been unaware of or
ignored  and benefitted greatly from a 1998 law that distributed
government  funding directly to cities instead of through state
governors,  who often allocated the money at their whimsey.
under  da silva, the town's annual budget jumped from $47,000 to
$1.9  million. he invested heavily in health, education and a sewage
system  that keeps the local river clean -- something practically
unheard  of in brazil's poor northeast.
''governing  is the easiest thing in the world, you just have to
want  to,'' said the tall, stubble-chinned da silva.
dias  seems genuinely stunned by the transformation.
''my  administration was there to help the people who suffer on
the  farm,'' he said. ''i did what i could with my small budget.''
but  the all-in-the-family harmony broke down in 1997, when a
constitutional  amendment allowed mayors to run for reelection.
dias,  who had expected to inherit the mayor's office again,
suddenly  faced opposition from his nephew. the two no longer speak.
dias  says his nephew's administration wasn't entirely selfless.
he  points to da silva's enormous house and sports utility vehicle
and  suggests that he also benefited from the recent cash inflow.
dias  is known for distributing food baskets, a traditional
election  time handout here. but he claims da silva has upped the
ante,  buying votes with unicef funds intended to replace the
unhealthy  mud shacks that are home for many residents. instead of
new  houses, dias says, the mayor offers renovations, and only to
those  who agree to vote for him.
da  silva denies he's doing anything wrong with the unicef money
but  admits political realities have forced him to engage in some of
the  more traditional voting getting methods.
''i  do good work and i do good politics too,'' counters da
silva,  known popularly as regente. ''buying votes exists. if a poor
person  is sick what are you going to do: let them die?''
still,  da silva appears to be trailing among voters. his support
is  strongest among the 2,000 who live near the newly restored town
square,  where he has created government jobs and improved social
services.
 but  the 8,000 voters on the small farms surrounding the town
seem  to like dias better. he mixes easily with the farmers and
field  hands, drinking cachaca -- a homemade sugar cane liquor -- and
smoking  corn husk cigarettes. farmer jose joaquim saraiva, 56,
admits  the mayor has done a lot for jaborandi but says he still
plans  to vote for dias.
''lidio  helped me a lot when he was in office,'' he says. ''if i
could  pay with a liter of cachaca or a kilo of beans i would, but i
can't.  the only way i can pay him is with my vote.''

port-of-spain,  trinidad (ap) -- a barge leaked an undetermined
amount  of marine diesel fuel off trinidad's shore in the gulf of
paria,  officials said saturday.
ministry  of energy officials were surveying the area off
northwestern  trinidad on saturday, the trinidadian coast guard
said.  by saturday it had reached from an area outside port-of-spain
about  five miles up to chaguaramas, on the caribbean island's

mooleedhar  was quoted as saying in the guardian newspaper saturday.
the  coast guard has declined to identify the barge suspected of
leaking  the fuel.
officials  plan to release more details about the spill in coming

 the  area harbors hundreds of yachts, and the fuel coated the
hulls  of nearly 160 boats, said amanda shaw, manager of the
trinidad  and tobago sailing association.
beaches  along the northwest of trinidad may have to be closed
for  several days for clean-up operations, mooleedhar was quoted as

trudeau  died thursday at age 80. he had been suffering from
prostate  cancer and parkinson's disease.
prime  minister jean chretien, gov. gen. adrienne clarkson,
justices,  generals, senior bureaucrats and politicians paid their
respects  in the morning before the doors of the parliament
building's  marble hall of honor were opened to the public.
sons  justin and sacha flanked their mother margaret as they
followed  the coffin, along with chretien and his wife, aline. the
prime  minister looked drawn as he stood before the remains of his
old  friend and mentor.
afterward,  all manner of ordinary folk filed past the coffin:
old  and young, men in business suits and teens in baggy jeans,
white-haired  matrons and soccer moms with tykes in tow.
patrick  gillespie, 30, of ottawa, said he had to be part of the
solemn  occasion.
''i  liked his flamboyance. canada has many heroes but not too
many  legends,'' said gillespie. ''his zest for life makes me want
to  copy it.''
trudeau  will lie in state on the hill until monday, when a
special,  black-draped funeral train will carry him home to montreal
to  lie in state again in mary queen of the world cathedral.
a  state funeral with a solemn roman catholic ritual will be held
tuesday  in the ornate grandeur of notre dame basilica.

[HEADLINE] :  de niro gets achievement award
[TEXT]
san  sebastian, spain (ap) -- robert de niro is known for his
ability  to adapt to a variety of roles. talking about his talents
isn't  one of them.
on  friday, de niro was presented with the donostia prize
lifetime  achievement award, a highlight of the san sebastian film
festival.
 known  for his reluctance to talk off screen as he is for
volatility  on screen, de niro's answers at a packed press
conference  were typically scant on detail and his smiles to an
eager  audience were few and far between.
de  niro, who has appeared in more than 50 movies, won an oscar
for  best supporting actor in ''the godfather, part ii'' in 1975.
eight  years later, he won the best actor award playing an aging
boxer  in ''raging bull.''
the  san sebastian festival, spain's leading film festival, was
to  wrap up saturday with the announcement of its prize winners.

[TEXT]
moscow  (ap) -- russians huddled in parkas indoors and ate cold
meals  in a siberian city and a southern province saturday after
natural  gas utility turned off the tap because of debts.
residents  of the siberian city of omsk told russia's
state-connected  ort television that they looked forward to riding
public  transport because it was the warmest place in town. one old
woman  wrapped in scarves heated tea on an old overturned iron
because  her gas stove doesn't work.
store  managers said demand for electric heaters, stoves and
teapots  had spiked since the gas was shut off. independent ntv
television  said talks between city officials and natural gas
monopoly  gazprom on resuming gas and fuel oil supplies had stalled.
gas  supplies have also been cut sharply to the entire southern
region  of north ossetia. kazbek karginov, first deputy premier of
the  province, urged gazprom to reschedule the debts before winter
sets  in, the itar-tass news agency said.
earlier  this month, an electrical utility cut off power to a
strategic  missile base for unpaid bills, panicking top government
officials.
 the  cutoffs highlight russia's chronic web of nonpayment, in
which  large companies and government agencies don't pay cash for
energy,  raw materials and taxes -- a habit that economists say drags
down  the economy.

[HEADLINE] :  five arrested in illegal lottery
[TEXT]
	  newark, n.j. (ap) - three new jersey residents and two new
yorkers  were arrested in what authorities have described as an
illegal  lottery with ties to organized crime.
the  new yorkers arrested after the six-week investigation were
taken  into custody in an apartment there that officials described
as  a ''layoff bank,'' a place where large bets were taken to be
paid  off if a bettor won.
arrested  at their new jersey homes were thomas abridello, 54, of
belleville;  alfonse ''tic'' cataldo, 58, of florham park; and mary
henderson,  60, of newark.
abridello  and henderson pleaded innocent on friday. cataldo had
his  arraignment postponed a week.
authorities  said cataldo, described as the head of the
operation,  is an associate of the lucchese crime family. at a
newark  hearing, assistant essex county prosecutor judy gagliano
said  he has three gambling-related convictions, including one as
recent  as 1995.
arrested  in new york were queens residents flimer porro, 25, and
mercedes  odano, 54. authorities said the new york part of the
operation  was under the control of cuban organized crime figures
that  had allied with the lucchese family.

gore  clings to electoral college lead
washington  (ap) -- the presidential campaign is tight and volatile across the
political  map, with al gore clinging to his lead in the hunt for electoral
votes,  according to an analysis by the associated press. sixteen states plus the
district  of columbia are leaning the vice president's way or solidly in his
column,  putting him at 226 electoral votes, 44 short of the 270 needed to win.
another  21 states with 175 electoral votes would go to george w. bush. that
leaves  13 tossup states with 137 electoral votes. polls show that gore and bush
hold  only narrow leads in several of their states, meaning the slightest
momentum  shift could reshape the race.
12  palestinians die in clashes
jerusalem  (ap) -- israeli troops battling several gunmen and thousands of
rock-throwing  palestinians opened fire on the rioters today, killing 12
palestinians  and wounding 523 in the bloodiest confrontations in the west bank
and  gaza strip since 1996. among those killed in the second day of deadly
clashes  was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the cross fire and screamed in
panic  as shots hit a wall just inches above his head. the trigger for the
violence  was a dispute over a bitterly contested jerusalem shrine sacred to
muslims  and jews.
clinton  pushes school construction
washington  (ap) -- president clinton, bemoaning what he said are too many
overcrowded  and crumbling schools, pledged today not to budge from budget talks
until  republicans set aside billions for school construction and his education
priorities.  he also released a department of education study showing that at
least  60 percent of schools in the country need repairs and that the work would
cost  an estimated $127 billion. ''we're not going to leave the (negotiating)
table  until we invest in modernizing our schools,'' clinton said in his weekly
radio  address.
man  attacks ill. abortion clinic
rockford,  ill. (ap) -- a man drove his car into the city's only abortion
clinic  today, then damaged the facility with an ax before the clinic's owner
confronted  him with a shotgun, authorities said. the clinic was not open and
nobody  was injured. the clinic houses the office of dr. richard ragsdale.
ragsdale  filed a landmark 1983 lawsuit challenging illinois abortion
restrictions,  contending that they required doctors performing abortions to
conduct  their practices in buildings that in effect are hospitals. rockford is
located  about 85 miles northwest of chicago.
cops  seek to block falun gong protest
beijing  (ap) -- police are checking vehicles entering china's capital to
thwart  a threatened protest by followers of the outlawed falun gong spiritual
movement  tomorrow, the 51st anniversary of communist rule, a rights group
reports.  spot checks on major roads around beijing began yesterday and continued
today  after two weeks of police sweeps that saw 600 falun gong members detained
in  nearby provinces, the hong kong-based information center of human rights and
democracy  reported. the report follows signs of government nervousness and
dispatches  in hong kong media that 10,000 sect followers were heading for
beijing.
 last  inmates leave belfast prison
belfast,  northern ireland (ap) -- the last four inmates have left the maze

process.  ''it's an end of an era and i hope we never return to the same
circumstances  that we have had these last 30 years,'' prison officers'
association  spokesman finlay spratt said today. the good friday agreement
provided  for early releases for prisoners affiliated with groups which declared
cease-fires,  including the irish republican army on the irish catholic side, and
the  ulster defense association and ulster volunteer force on the british
protestant  side.

lollar  and another man in atlanta in january. lewis ended his trial by pleading
guilty  to a misdemeanor charge of obstruction of justice. the pro bowl player

else  has been charged. relatives of lollar will stand outside cleveland browns

[TEXT]
philadelphia  (ap) -- police officers will not be charged for
shooting  a carjacking suspect, but an investigation will continue
into  his televised beating, newspapers reported saturday.
police  fired nearly 50 rounds at thomas jones, 30, who was
chased  on foot and in cars after he was spotted driving a stolen
car  on july 12. jones eventually jumped into an empty police
cruiser  and drove off before being stopped by police.
a  television news helicopter videotaped police officers kicking
and  punching jones during the arrest, images that were broadcast
around  the nation. he was hospitalized for more than three weeks
with  five gunshot wounds to his arm and stomach.
the  city district attorney will not prosecute any officers on
criminal  charges in jones' shooting, saturday's editions of the
philadelphia  inquirer and philadelphia daily news reported. both
cited  unnamed sources within the police department.
officers  could still face criminal charges for the beating of
jones.  those who shot him could also face disciplinary sanctions
from  the department for violating its firearms policy.
jones  is being held on $1 million bail, awaiting a preliminary
hearing  nov. 2 on more than 70 criminal charges, including eight
purse  snatchings and two carjackings.
a  district attorney spokeswoman refused to comment on the police
statements,  saying the investigation into the entire jones matter
was  continuing.
the  shooting, chase and arrest is being investigated by
philadelphia  district attorney lynne m. abraham, the city police
department,  the fbi and the federal justice department's civil
rights  division.

[HEADLINE] :  runner ottey says she may not retire
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- don't say farewell to merlene ottey
just  yet.
in  what she had described beforehand as her final race, ottey
anchored  the jamaican team to a silver medal saturday night in the
400-meter  relay at the sydney olympics.
the  40-year-old has competed in six olympics during her 20-year
career  and won eight medals. but, within minutes of completing the
relay,  she was already hedging on retirement.
''i  said a year ago that after the olympics i would retire,''
she  said. ''but i'm not sure actually. i had such a rough year.
it's  been a fight trying to get on the team.
''i  had just two months to prepare for the olympics. i thought i
did  a fantastic job. i missed out on a medal in the 100. but i'm
happy  i came. it could have been worse. i will consider continuing
on.''
 ottey,  who finished fourth in the 100 last weekend, is the most
decorated  woman in track and field athlete, with 35 medals in major
championships.  but she never won an olympic gold.
ottey  said just competing in sydney was a triumph.
she  tested positive for traces of the steroid nandrolone in july
1999,  forcing her to pull out of the world championships in
seville,  spain.
the  international amateur athletic federation suspended her, but
she  was cleared by her national federation. the iaaf sent the case
to  its arbitration panel, which lifted the ban on july 3 on grounds
that  her urine sample was improperly tested.
ottey  was asked whether she felt any sympathy for c.j. hunter,
the  shot putter and husband of u.s. sprinter marion jones.
international  track officials said hunter tested positive four
times  this summer for nandrolone.
''i've  never really taken up for anybody regarding doping,''
ottey  said. ''i can only speak for myself. but if he's innocent, i
can  only imagine what he's going through, because i know what i
went  through. as far as if he did it or not, i have no idea. if
he's  innocent, it's a very, very bad feeling to be wrongly
accused.''
 the  gold in the relay went to the bahamas in 41.95 seconds,
followed  by jamaica in 42.13 and the united states in 42.20.
ottey  said she was thrilled that caribbean nations finished 1-2.
''i've  seen a lot of change in my career,'' she said. ''twenty
years  ago, when i started, we didn't have a lot of caribbean
athletes  on the podium. what's changed is the women are doing
better  than the men.
''people  are now believing in us. they believe we can also
perform  well and they're giving us a chance. in the past, we've
never  had a chance.
''people  should start paying attention to the caribbean. they
should  put more money into the region to support track and field.
hopefully,  we can do well in other sports, too, not just track in
field.''

[HEADLINE] :  lisa leslie happy with hoops gold
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- not even a scalping of lisa leslie
could  stop the u.s. women's basketball team.
when  australia's lauren jackson yanked off leslie's braided hair
extension  in a tussle under the boards, it was the final indignity
the  americans would suffer.
leslie  picked up her plait, tossed it to a startled
photographer,  then caught up with jackson at the other end of the
court.
 ''you  can have that,'' leslie told her. ''i'll take the gold.''
and  so leslie and the rest of the americans did, finishing off
the  australians 76-54 saturday to win their second straight olympic
title.
 this  was the kind of game the americans have been waiting to
play  since they arrived down under, an end-to-end rumble in which
they  unleashed two weeks of pent-up annoyance at the aussies and
let  loose a deep, talented lineup that seemed bottled up too long.
''it  definitely was our best performance,'' leslie said. ''we
had  to go out and make it an ugly game for australia.''
ever  since they came here, the americans kept hearing how they
couldn't  run with the australians, couldn't shoot with them, and
sure  couldn't beat them on their home court. the newspapers arrived
each  day with more and more taunts by the australians, more and
more  digs by local wags about how their beloved opals would give
the  americans, thrown together slapdash from wnba teams, their
comeuppance  in the final.
''australia  challenged us not just on the court but in our
hearts  and minds,'' leslie said. ''i don't think any of my
teammates  slept last night. we were tired before the game
started.''
 at  the heart of the hype was a real or imagined feud between the
6-foot-5  centers, the 28-year-old leslie and the 19-year-old
jackson,  stemming from a chest-bumping confrontation in an
exhibition  game before the olympics. leslie said it never happened,
jackson  said it most certainly did.
so  it came down to the gold medal game, and the trash talking
gave  way to some serious bumping and elbowing, players bouncing off
each  other and the court as if a hockey game had broken out.
the  packed crowd of 15,000 in the superdome added to the
feverish  mood, with green-and-yellow painted australians competing
with  flag-waving americans for supremacy. the american men's
basketball  team sat at courtside, lending its support, with alonzo
mourning  holding up a sign that read, ''usa came down under, got
gold!''
 leslie  and jackson did a fair share of the shoving, jostling
each  under the boards, going at each other from end to end. leslie
would  drive, and jackson would match her. jackson would pop from
the  outside, and leslie would try to do the same. jackson got in a
few  blocks, including a couple on leslie, and leslie came back with
a  few assists.
the  americans, with their solid bench and stronger, more
experienced  players, stayed ahead the whole game, building a 43-30
lead  at halftime and never letting the lead fall to less than seven
points  in the second half.
australia's  frustration mounted as the americans pulled away,
and  when yolanda griffith tapped in an offensive rebound to make it
70-51  with 5 minutes to go, the tension reached a peak.
in  a scuffle for a ball under the boards, jackson tore off
leslie's  long braid, leaving the embarrassed american to play the
rest  of the game with just a tiny bun on top of her head.
''she  pulled it off intentionally,'' leslie claimed. ''i was
surprised  she did that to me. trust me, she had to pull it really
hard,  because it was pinned in tight. she knew what she was
doing.''
 jackson  scoffed at that, saying ''my fingers got caught as i
went  for the ball. it certainly wasn't intentional.''
deliberate  or not, leslie's perception of what happened was
indicative  of how the teams felt about each other and how much was
at  stake.
''when  you feed us a diet of the stuff we were hearing, day
after  day, it's a lot of motivation,'' leslie said. ''i said this
day  would come, and we'd answer them on the court.''
the  americans answered with balance all over the court -- leslie
and  natalie williams scoring 15, sheryl swoopes 14, griffith 13,
nikki  mccray 8.
jackson,  who may be headed to the wnba in a few years, came up
with  20 points and 13 rebounds, but had little help from the rest
of  the opals.
though  annoyed by the hair-pulling incident, leslie said her
respect  for jackson as a player was undiminished. yet, leslie
couldn't  resist one parting verbal punch.
''i  have a gold medal, and i'm going home,'' leslie said. ''if
she  wants to come to the wnba, she can meet me on my turf.''

[HEADLINE] :  us hoops coach answers doubters
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the final seconds were winding down and
nell  fortner was able to stop coaching and start hugging.
the  gold medal was assured for the u.s. women's olympic
basketball  team and the coach few had heard of three years ago had
answered  all the skeptics.
''i  wish you could jump inside my body and feel that personal
satisfaction.  it's just great,'' fortner said after the 76-54
victory  over australia ended her three-year run as the coach of the
women's  national team.
fortner,  41, was given the job in 1997 despite having just one
year  as a head coach on any level. she left purdue, a team to she
led  to a 17-11 record and the second round of the ncaa tournament
after  one season.
in  1996, the coach of the u.s. women's team was tara vanderveer,
a  coach with a national reputation. fortner was a well-known
assistant  at stephen f. austin and then louisiana tech.
the  players on a talent-laden u.s. were willing to give her a
chance.  she showed she could handle international competition by
coaching  10 teams in the three years to a combined record of 84-14
in  events like the pan am games, the world championships and the
jones  cup.
''the  biggest thing was that nell has grown with the game,''
u.s.  guard and soon-to-be temple head coach dawn staley said. ''she
had  one year of head coaching experience, none with pro athletes.
over  the years she had an understanding of how we approach the game
and  how she wants the game played and we kind of met in the middle.
''she  wanted things her way and she did, but we compromised in
some  areas and she listened. it was an awesome relationship.''
fortner,  who was an aide to vanderveer with the 1996 gold medal
team,  never looked at the lack of head coaching experience as a
detriment.
 ''i  always believed in these players and i think the key was
they  believed in me, too. that's a pretty good combination to start
with,''  she said. ''you work hard and have players who are making
sacrifices  and are committed to what you're doing and that makes
all  the difference. i feel very satisfied.''
those  final seconds saturday night, when fortner could stop
roaming  in front of the bench and start exchanging congratulations
with  her players, were the most special of the three years.
''it  was wonderful, a huge sense of relief, a huge sense of
pride,''  she said, her voice starting to break up just a bit. ''i
was  so happy for the players. they're always coming up behind me
and  saying 'nell, don't worry about it, don't worry about it.' but
coaches  worry. that's our job.
''there's  no question if you win with these players you're
supposed  to win and if you lose it's the coach's fault. that's a
tremendous  amount of pressure, especially playing on a contender's
home  court. i can't tell you how much i believe in these players
and  how good they are. it's been a great experience.''
fortner  seemed most emotional talking about five-time olympian
teresa  edwards and staley, her point guards.
''i  think a player-coach relationship is believing in each other
and  a coach has a different relationship with their point guards,''
she  said. ''with those two, they're the ones you've got to run it
through.''
 and  she did.
''i  think coaches, when they prepare for something as big as
this,  they second-guess themselves, you know, the type of team,
what  offense to run, things like that,'' staley said. ''but 't' and
i  had a talk with her just to reassure her that what she put in
will  work. you just have to let the machine run its course and she
listened  and let us do that.''

[HEADLINE] :  olympic roundup
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- michael johnson and marion jones
wrapped  up their olympics the same way they started them: in
spectacular  sprints to gold-medal finishes.
the  two american track icons shared the wealth on the medal
stands  saturday, both joined by their teammates in the 1,600-meter
relay.  and there was more gold for the united states: the u.s.
women's  basketball team successfully defended its olympic gold, and
the  men's 400-meter relay team finished first.
for  the u.s. track team, it started and finished with jones, who
thrived  in the sydney spotlight. she leaves australia with three
golds  and two bronzes -- falling short of her goal of five golds but
still  becoming the first woman to capture five medals in a single
olympics.
 she  also became the first woman since florence griffith joyner
in  1988 to win three track golds in one games. and she did most of
it  while shrugging off allegations that her husband, shot putter
c.j.  hunter, had used steroids.
jones  won the 100- and 200-meter sprints, took a bronze in the
long  jump and a bronze in the 400-meter relay, then closed out
saturday  with a gold in the 1,600 relay.
jones  ran a spectacular third leg, moving from second place into
a  comfortable 15-meter lead before handing off to anchor latasha
colander-richardson.  though not usually a 400-meter runner -- and
with  no desire to be one -- jones shared with individual 400
champion  cathy freeman the distinction of having the fastest leg of
any  runner in the relay final.
''in  a couple of days, when i look back, i'll probably feel
these  were successful games,'' jones said. ''i wanted to win them
all,  without a doubt, and i still think it's possible. but i
didn't,  so i'm not going to dwell on that.''
johnson,  in his farewell olympic appearance, anchored the men's
1,600  relay team to capture his fifth gold medal over three summer
games.  across an amazing career, johnson has won nothing but gold --
five  olympic and nine world championship medals.
he  earlier won the 400 in sydney.
led  by 100-meter champion maurice greene on the anchor leg, the
americans  won the men's 400-meter relay -- but the four-man team
drew  more attention with their-post race antics, an assortment of
wwf-style  poses and muscle-flexing.
in  the 1,500 meters, suzy favor hamilton's bid to become the
first  american medalist in the event ended when she collapsed about
75  meters from the finish line and finished last. suffering from
dehydration,  she was taken off the track in a wheelchair.
marla  runyan, the first legally blind athlete to compete in the
olympics,  took the lead early in the race because she was
frustrated  with the pace but wound up eighth -- ''which the first
time  around is not bad,'' she said.
''and,  i'm going to be back.''
with  one day left in the sydney games, the americans were poised
to  collect the most medals, leading the pack with 90 (38 gold, 22
silver,  30 bronze). running second was russia with 77 (28-24-25),
followed  by china's 59 (28-16-15).
------
 --  women's basketball: talk about winning on the road.
the  u.s. hoopsters faced host australia before a rabid crowd
eager  to see the gold medal come home -- and sent the locals home
disappointed.  the americans, winners of the atlanta games, took
their  second straight gold with a 76-54 thrashing of australia.
''we  played hard, we played great,'' u.s. center lisa leslie
said.  ''we knew we could do it, but it's still an amazing feeling
to  do it on someone else's homecourt.''
the  americans won with rebounding and defense, holding australia
to  31 percent shooting while winning the battle of the boards
48-27.  leslie and natalie williams led the americans with 15 points
each,  while yolanda griffith added 13 points and 12 rebounds.
the  u.s. women led by 13 at halftime, and quickly answered
australia's  one second-half run to put the game away. the u.s. team
has  now won the last two olympics and the 1998 world championships.
australia's  silver medal marked the nation's highest finish ever
in  women's basketball.
------
 --  wrestling: the americans took a pair of silver medals as two
wrestlers  were defeated in their gold medal matches. brandon slay,
in  his first major international meet, lost 4-0 to alexander
leipold  of germany at 167&amp;frac12; pounds.
u.s.  veteran sammie henson lost 4-3 to namig abdullayev of
azerbaijan  at 119 pounds.
gold  medalist rulon gardner, who ended the 13-year undefeated
streak  of russian super heavyweight alexander karelin, will carry
the  u.s. flag during the olympic closing ceremony sunday.
------
 --  water polo: after blowing two leads, the u.s. men regrouped to
defeat  croatia 9-8 in overtime -- a victory that lifted them into
the  game for fifth place.
chris  humbert's third goal, a cannon-shot from a quarter
pool-length  away with 1.4 seconds left in extra time, was the game
winner  for the united states (3-4-0). the americans close out play
sunday  (saturday night edt).

[HEADLINE] :  no medal for diver mark ruiz
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- mark ruiz put on a smile for family and
friends  as he pulled himself from the water one last time. the
scoreboard  flashed 9s and 9.5s -- his best dive of the night.
but  that final flourish couldn't mask the disappointment of
leaving  sydney without a medal hanging from his neck.
''honestly,  i'm a little depressed,'' said ruiz, whose first
olympics  ended with a sixth-place finish saturday in the 10-meter
platform.  ''i'm not the kind of guy who's going to come in here and
say  no matter what i do, i'll be happy.''
the  21-year-old came down under carrying the weight of his
native  puerto rico, his adopted home in america and the mother who
gave  up everything so he could have a better life.
he  wanted a medal. he wanted it soooo bad.
instead,  he settled for a pair of seventh-place finishes in
3-meter  springboard and synchronized platform before placing well
behind  a 1-2 chinese rout in the last diving event of the games.
''i  shouldn't be upset,'' ruiz said. ''i did pretty well. but i
am  upset.''
tian  liang outlasted teammate hu jia in a battle of perfect 10s
to  win the platform, completing another stunning performance by the
chinese.
 they  became the first country to win five diving gold medals,
adding  five silvers just to drive home their complete dominance
over  the rest of the world.
china's  acrobatic army captured three of the four individual
events,  just as it had done at the last two olympics. the medal
count  reached record numbers because the program was expanded from
four  to eight events this year.
''they  were awesome,'' american coach jay lerew said. ''when
they're  on their game, they're unbelievable.''
still,  ruiz thought he could compete with the chinese.
a  16-time u.s. champion, he drew the obvious comparisons to greg
louganis  after becoming the first diver since the great one to
qualify  for both individual men's events at the olympics.
but  ruiz lost his edge when matched against the world's best.
''he's  young and inexperienced,'' lerew said. ''he needs more
experience.  he can do the dives as well as the rest of them. he
just  needs a little more time.''
growing  up in puerto rico, ruiz spent a lot of time at a river
near  his home, jumping from rocks and trees. his mother took him
for  swimming lessons, but he wouldn't stay in the pool. all he
wanted  to do was jump in.
a  career was born.
lydia  torres gave up her home and business to bring her youngest
son  to the unites states when he was only 13. they wound up in
orlando,  fla., sharing a one-bedroom apartment that was close to a
pool  where he could train.
''he  was born to be a diver,'' torres said.
ruiz  wanted to do well to repay his mother for all the
sacrifices  she made. he also felt the tug from both his adopted and
native  lands, fully aware that both were watching.
''i  let myself down and i let my country down,'' he said. ''i
wanted  to bring home this medal for the united states and puerto
rico.  i let them both down.''
he  wasn't alone. the americans captured only one medal -- laura
wilkinson's  surprising gold in the women's platform -- and left
sydney  with their lightest haul since 1912, excluding the boycotted
moscow  games.
david  pichler of butler, pa., who finished ninth in the
10-meter,  said a lack of financial support has left the americans
playing  catch-up in a sport they once dominated.
''one  thing they can do is take care of us a little bit,'' the
32-year-old  said. ''i have to work 30 hours a week just to dive.''
the  government-supported chinese showed their depth with the 1-2
finish  in platform. hu, only 17, was a late replacement for an
injured  teammate and wound up with silver.
''we're  very satisfied,'' said coach zhang ting, wearing a mao
badge  on his t-shirt. ''to get so many golds in an olympics is
quite  hard.''
the  chinese dominated from start to finish -- tian winning with
724.53  points, hu next at 713.55. defending champion dmitry sautin
of  russia earned bronze with 679.26, his fourth medal in sydney.
''every  time i see my chinese colleagues, i see a certain
consistency  to their performance,'' said sautin, a three-time
olympian.  ''i find it more and more difficult to compete with
them.''
 for  comparisons' sake, ruiz had 625.92 points after pulling off
his  best dive at the end. pichler totaled 616.17 to finish three
places  lower than he did on platform in atlanta four years ago.
''diving  is so deep around the world now,'' lerew said. ''every
year,  it gets deeper and deeper.''

[HEADLINE] :  gold-medal defeats turn ugly for us
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- a remarkably good olympics for the u.s.
freestyle  wrestlers turned ugly with two gold-medal losses.
sammie  henson, who said he wasn't interested in a silver medal,
got  exactly that by losing 5-4 at 119 pounds saturday to the
wrestler  he beat for the 1998 world championship.
then,  as he sobbed uncontrollably on the mat and during the
medal  ceremony, he was jeered by a crowd that felt he was an
ungracious  loser.
brandon  slay's complaint after losing 4-0 at 167&amp;frac12; pounds: he
wasn't  allowed to wrestle at all.
slay  also was jeered -- much more loudly than henson -- when he
wouldn't  shake the hand of referee borje schoug of sweden.
the  losses clearly upset not only the wrestlers but their
coaches,  who had seen the u.s. team win 12 consecutive matches in
sydney.  four more americans could win medals sunday.
''these  guys work six, seven, 10 years to get here and they take
a  lot of pride in winning gold medals,'' u.s. co-coach john smith
said.
 smith,  a two-time olympic champion, even wondered if there was
an  anti-american bias at work, intentional or not.
''the  united states was on good roll, it was obvious,'' he said.
henson,  of st. charles, mo., fell behind namig abdullayev of
azerbaijan  3-0 with 45 seconds gone and never recovered. henson
rallied  to tie it, but abdullayev scored the winning point with a
reversal  at 4:27 of the 6-minute match.
abdullayev  found a particularly useful way to fight off henson,
repeatedly  pulling on the straps of henson's singlet. the trick is
not  permitted by the rules, but referee abbass namazian of iran did
not  stop him.
''it  should be a point for grabbing the clothes -- he was
blocking  his moves -- but they didn't call it,'' smith said. ''we
needed  that (penalty) point, and we didn't get it.''
germany's  alexander leipold got his first three points on
penalties  against slay, with the other coming after slay began
taking  desperate chances to score.
''i  believe politics is a part of this sport, and it's
unfortunate  what happened,'' slay said. ''it's unfortunate when you
give  your all to win and it's taken out of your hands.''
the  match changed as slay and leipold locked into the clinch
that  starts the second period when there is no score. as they began
to  lock up, slay apparently did not position his shoulder the way
the  referee wanted.
''i  let him get locked and then i locked, and then he (leipold)
starts  whining and crying like a baby that he can't get his hands
locked,''  slay said. ''he was acting to the officials, hoping they
would  give him points, and they did.''
after  several seconds, the referee abruptly stopped, cautioned
slay  and called him for an illegal hold, giving leipold a 2-0 lead.
leipold  was later given another point when slay was cautioned
again,  apparently for grabbing leipold's hands as the german
applied  a gut wrench.
''what's  frustrating is i felt he couldn't beat me,'' slay said.
''but  i never got the chance to wrestle him.''
unlike  the early rounds of the olympics, when results can be
protested  and frequently are, there can be no protests of
medal-round  matches.
''sunday  is my last day on the job, and i can honestly say i'm
happy  and it's because of situations like this,'' said bruce
burnett,  who is leaving the u.s. freestyle team to coach at navy.
''i  saw a lot of points being put up and not a lot being scored.''
leipold  was elated to get a gold medal virtually nobody expected
him  to win. he has been unable to beat russia's four-time world
champion,  bouvaissa saitiev, but he was eliminated by slay in pool
competition.
 ''he  can come back and win two gold medals,'' leipold said,
referring  to slay, who turns 25 in two weeks.
slay  didn't especially like that comment, saying, ''who knows
where  i'll be in four years, or eight? i came here to win this gold
medal,  tonight.''

[HEADLINE] :  giants deactivate pk daluiso
[TEXT]
east  rutherford, n.j. (ap) -- giants kicker brad daluiso won't
play  sunday because of a bad back, and new york signed jaret holmes
for  the game against the tennessee titans.
''i  just felt it was too risky to see if brad was going to be ok
for  tomorrow's game,'' giants coach jim fassel said saturday. ''his
back  still concerns me, and i couldn't take that chance. we are
going  to leave brad at home so he can take the next two or three
days  to try to get better.''
daluiso,  who missed the final 10 games of last season because of
a  knee injury, experienced tightness in his back on wednesday. he
sat  out of drills on thursday.
holmes  was waived by the chicago bears before the start of the
season.  he was on the bears' and giants' practice squads last
season  before being signed to the bears' active roster dec. 13.
to  make room for holmes, the giants waived linebacker kevin
lewis.  he made the team as a free agent but he had not been active
for  any game.

[HEADLINE] :  russia gets gold in rhythmic group
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- the russians won by a ribbon. and a
club.
 russia  edged belarus for the gold medal saturday in the rhythmic
gymnastics  group competition, winning in a tiebreaker. both teams
finished  with 39.500 points, but russia won because its highest and
lowest  scores -- thrown out in the initial scoring -- were better.
belarus,  which finished sixth at the atlanta olympics, got the
silver.
 greece,  the silver medalist at last year's world championships,
had  to settle for the olympic bronze after dropping a club in the
first  event. the greeks actually topped both russia and belarus in
the  second event, hoop and ribbon, but it wasn't enough to overcome
their  early mistake.
''we  really wanted gold,'' said anna pollatou of greece.
''however,  we will aim for gold in athens in 2004.''
the  united states didn't qualify for either group or the
individual  event. the individual all-around final is sunday, and
world  champion alina kabaeva of russia is favored.
the  russians are three-time world champions, but they could
manage  only the bronze medal four years ago when the group
competition  made its olympic debut. they were determined to do
better  this time.
they  strutted onto the floor for their first event with an
attitude,  the clubs, and the outfits to match. they wore
dominatrix-like  costumes, with their leotard tops trimmed in silver
to  look like bustiers and oval cut-outs all the way up their legs.
performing  to the funky beat of ''the matrix,'' they tossed
their  clubs high in the air while contorting their bodies in shapes
not  seen since gumby. with sultry dance steps they moved in perfect
unison  and harmony.
the  russians scored a 19.800 for the clubs, the same as belarus.
in  the second event, a combination of the hoops and ribbons, the
belarussians  flitted across the floor like little girls on a
playground.  as four team members pulled three ribbons taut in a
crisscross,  the fifth threw a hoop high in the air, letting it drop
gently  down onto the ribbons and bounce back up again.
they  threw hoops to each other across the floor, deftly catching
the  whirling orbs as they balanced on tiptoe. with ribbons swirling
above  their heads, they twisted and turned with ease, but it wasn't
enough  to top the russians.
''russia  was instrumental in initiating the group
performances,''  said valentina ivanizkaya, a russian assistant
coach.  ''it was their dream to win.''

[HEADLINE] :  us quiets fans with win over aussies
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- there's been bad blood between these
teams  since atlanta.
the  australians had been laying for the americans ever since
losing  to them twice at the 1996 summer games and settling for the
bronze  medal.
this  time they vowed it would be different. their terms, their
turf,  their fans.
their  gold? no way.
capping  a perfect olympic tournament that was far more
challenging  than the romp through atlanta in 1996, the united
states  beat australia 76-54 saturday to win the gold medal.
the  americans did it with their usual combination of quickness,
depth  and strong inside play, knocking australia off its game early
and  taking the crowd out of it as well.
''we  wanted to stifle the crowd at the beginning,'' natalie
williams  said. ''we knew that if we got a good lead, they would
quiet  down.''
a  15-point lead in the first half did the trick and ruined what
the  australians had hoped would be their finest moment in
basketball.
 fans  roared from the moment their beloved opals first appeared.
they  waved flags and held signs. several australian athletes shed
their  shirts and painted their chests. it was like the cameron
crazies  from duke had gone down under.
not  that the u.s. players were surprised. fans had cheered for
their  opponents throughout the tournament and even booed the
americans  at times. when the united states beat south korea in the
semifinals  on friday, you would have thought the game was in seoul.
''they  were all cheering for korea and we knew there weren't
that  many koreans here,'' sheryl swoopes said. ''but we expected
that.  that's what makes it fun and exciting. that's what you work
for.''
 by  the end, the only cheers were coming from the small band of
u.s.  fans led by the players' families and dream teamers alonzo
mourning  and vince carter, who had draped himself with an american
flag.
 ''we  played hard, we played great,'' lisa leslie said. ''we knew
we  could do it, but it's still an amazing feeling to do it on
someone  else's homecourt.''
australia  got a strong game from 19-year-old lauren jackson, who
had  20 points and 13 rebounds. but by herself she was no match for
the  u.s. post trio of leslie, williams and yolanda griffith.
leslie  was too quick, williams and griffith too strong. williams
and  leslie each scored 15 points and grabbed nine rebounds.
griffith  added 13 points and 12 rebounds. swoopes scored 14 points.
''i  felt if i got low and on the block, i could turn and
score,''  said williams, an explosive jumper with a wide body.
''they  were trying to double team, but a few times i got
one-on-ones  and i felt there was nothing they could do to stop me
inside.  i wanted it too much.''
the  game was loosely officiated and players often banged into
each  with nothing called. swoopes and australia's kristi harrower
jawed  briefly as they walked off the floor at halftime and the
crowd  booed when griffith and michele timms got tangled up near the
u.s.  basket and tumbled to the floor.
with  about 5 minutes left, leslie lost her braided hair
extension  and accused jackson of pulling it off.
''that's  all right. she can have the hair,'' leslie said. ''i
have  the gold.''
jackson  said it was an accident.
''my  fingers got caught as i went for the ball,'' she said. ''it
certainly  wasn't intentional.''
the  hair caper aside, this one belonged to the united states
from  the start.
swoopes,  who had left the south korea game with a sore knee,
scored  the team's first three baskets and fed nikki mccray for the
fourth.  everyone should be so sore.
the  united states led 26-18 after griffith and williams
converted  back-to-back three-point plays. leslie finished a 9-0 run
with  five straight points to make it 35-23, and griffith's jumper
put  the americans up 43-28. that was the plan: jump on the
australians  early and don't let them up.
''we  had to,'' said teresa edwards, who collected her fourth
gold  medal in her fifth and final olympics. ''we were on their
floor.  we were on a foreign court. we had to go at them and hope
the  game went our way.''
australia  got the lead down to seven early in the second half
and  trailed 53-45 with 13:44 left, still plenty of time to make a
move.
 forget  it. williams had five points and an assist a 7-0 run that
took  the lead to 60-45 and it was never below 13 after that. the
united  states was pulling away at the end, and then the celebration
began.
 griffith  rushed into the stands to hug her 11-year-old daughter,
candace.  dawn staley grabbed the flag from carter and draped it
over  her shoulders as she paraded around the court, then handed it
off  and turned cartwheels.
leslie  also found a flag to wear and other players waved smaller
flags  on sticks, delisha milton strutting and gyrating as she held
hers.  they had come straight out of the wnba season and gone 8-0
over  a tough two weeks. a little dancing was in order.
''it  was definitely our best performance,'' leslie said. ''we
had  to go out and make it an ugly game for australia.''
it  was. but oh so beautiful for the united states.

[HEADLINE] :  pressure on boxers juarez, williams
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- for rocky juarez and ricardo williams
jr.,  a lot more than just an olympic gold medal is at stake when
they  enter the ring for sunday's boxing finals.
professional  riches await, but only if the medal is gold.
''the  only thing people remember is the gold. no one remembers
if  you win silver or bronze,'' u.s. coach tom mustin said.
the  $15,000 that u.s. olympic officials pay for a gold is nice,
but  for boxing gold medalists there's a real pot of gold in their
future.  oscar de la hoya found that out when he cashed in as the
only  american boxing gold medalist in 1992. four years later, david
reid  guaranteed himself millions when he knocked out a cuban to win
his  gold.
in  back-to-back gold medal fights sunday, juarez takes on bekzat
sattarkhanov  of kazakstan at 125 pounds and williams fights
mahamadkadyz  abdullaev of uzbekistan at 139 pounds.
a  handful of promoters and would-be managers will be in the
stands  watching to see if juarez and williams have what it takes to
sell  tickets as a pro.
''i  don't know if they (promoters) have been talking to them
already  or not,'' mustin said. ''i hope not, because it can be a
distraction.  but we can't watch these guys 24 hours a day.''
boxers  are prohibited from signing with promoters while still
fighting  for the u.s. team. but all bets are off the minute a gold
medal  goes around the neck of an american boxer.
de  la hoya parlayed his gold into a pro career that has seen him
earn  more than $100 million. reid got a $1 million signing bonus
after  winning his gold in atlanta, and has made millions more in
the  ring.
five  other americans won bronze medals in atlanta, and faced a
tougher  time making money. one of them, floyd mayweather jr., is
now  a champion and making good purses but even he had to start with
small  money fights because he didn't have a gold.
williams  may have the tougher road. he's fighting the 1999 world
champion  in abdullaev, who beat williams 11-4 when the two met in
the  second round of the world championships.
''this  is the fight i've been waiting for my whole life,''
williams  said.
juarez  hasn't lost in 68 fights over a period of two years, and
has  fought relentlessly throughout the olympics.
''this  game is just whoever wants it more,'' juarez said. ''i
can't  imagine anyone wanting it more than me.''
evander  holyfield, who knows a bit about fighting as a pro,
believes  juarez has a big future in the ring.
''he  fights like a pro now,'' holyfield said.
mustin  said it can be more difficult for u.s. boxers to keep
focused  on the olympics when many are already looking into the
future.
 u.s.  boxers will end up with only four medals in sydney, and it
will  be up to williams and juarez if the team will increase its
lone  gold medal counts from the previous olympics.
''for  other countries, their sole purpose is to win a medal for
their  country,'' mustin said. ''a lot of times our guys may look
past  the medal because they may have offers already.''

[HEADLINE] :  arabs express anger over clashes
[TEXT]
cairo,  egypt (ap) -- arab leaders criticized israel on saturday
for  deadly clashes in palestinian areas, while palestinian refugees
in  lebanon and egyptian university students vented their anger and
sadness.
 four  palestinian groups in syria that oppose peacemaking with
israel  also renewed their calls for palestinian leader yasser
arafat  to scrap efforts to negotiate peace with israel in favor of
armed  struggle.
''our  people, who have been breast-fed with love of martyrdom
and  grew up among bullets and deadly bombs, are always ready to
fight  their enemy,'' the islamic militant group hamas said in a
statement.
 arafat  was in egypt, where he briefed president hosni mubarak,
arab  league secretary-general esmat abdel-meguid and the european
union's  mideast envoy, miguel moratinos on the three days of
violence  that has left 18 palestinians dead and injured more than
500  people.
a  general strike and day of mourning was observed in lebanon's
13  refugee camps, home to many of the 400,000 palestinian refugees
in  lebanon. shops and schools were closed.
clashes  began thursday moments after ariel sharon, leader of the
likud  party, visited haram as-sharif, or the noble sanctuary -- a
site  also holy to jews as temple mount -- to show israel's control
over  the area. the mosque compound is the third-holiest site in
islam.
 egyptian  foreign minister amr moussa said mubarak spoke by
telephone  with israeli prime minister ehud barak and ''expressed
his  anger'' over the violence. ''what is needed is self
restraint,''  moussa told reporters.
abdel-meguid  said the 22 ambassadors to the cairo-based league
would  meet in emergency session sunday to discuss the clashes in
east  jerusalem, the west bank and gaza strip. he said arafat
requested  the meeting.
''we  strongly condemn the likud leader, ariel sharon, whose
provocative  actions led to this bloodshed,'' abdel-meguid told the
associated  press.
abdel-meguid  said moratinos, the eu envoy, told him he will
discuss  the situation with european and israeli officials.
jordanian  prime minister ali abu-ragheb warned the region could
be  experiencing ''a new cycle of violence that might be difficult
to  control.''
in  a statement carried by jordan's petra news agency, abu-ragheb
condemned  israeli soldiers for firing on stone-throwers after
friday  prayers at the mosque compound.
''these  actions harm the feelings of arabs and muslims,'' he
said.  ''we condemn the atrocious crime that was committed by
israeli  soldiers against innocent worshippers in haram as-sharif.''
jordan's  most prominent opposition group, the muslim brotherhood
movement,  urged the government to ''cease all dealings with the
(israeli)  enemy and dismiss its ambassador in jordan as a step
toward  canceling the (1994 jordanian-israeli peace) treaty.''
in  lebanon, prime minister salim hoss praised the rioters in
''occupied  palestine'' and called on the world to ''work for an
immediate  halt to the israeli aggression against arab jerusalem.''
on  the streets of ein el-hilweh, lebanon's largest refugee camp,
1,000  youths carrying palestinian flags marched, shouting: ''we
live  for palestine! we die for palestine!'' palestinian guerrillas
trampled  the israeli flag.
in  alexandria, egypt, police said 5,000 students, many carrying
banners  reading ''jerusalem is islamic,'' demonstrated on campuses
in  the mediterranean port city.

[HEADLINE] :  hungary-russia water polo a rematch
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- hungary and russia hope their
gold-medal  match sunday is remembered for grace and talent, not the
fear  and horror seen in an australian pool 44 years ago.
the  olympic men's water polo final matches the two nations that
gave  the sport its most infamous moment at the melbourne games --
the  gashed face of hungary's ervin zador, pool water mixing with
his  blood.
''that  was another time,'' hungary's tamas kasas said saturday
after  his team defeated yugoslavia 8-7 to advance to its first
final  since 1972. ''there's not really any other explanation.''
that  match came soon after the soviet union crushed hungary's
revolt.  zador, now living in california, says the game was a chance
for  his teammates to fight for their people.
the  hungarians, zador said, would frustrate the russians with
harsh  words and physical play. the goal was as much athletic -- to
win  a gold medal for hungary -- as political, zador said.
''we  got out of control,'' zador said by phone last month.
the  match was stopped with hungary ahead 4-0 as fans left the
stands  to surround railings near the pool. police escorted the
russian  team to safety.
but  the world was shocked by the pictures of zador's wounds.
water  polo, a sport known for its brutality, gained an even more
chilling  reputation.
''it  is hard for anyone who saw it to forget,'' zador said.
the  game's legend is strong in australia, whose people seem as
fascinated  with the contest as repelled, australian women's coach
istvan  gorgenyi said. ''they want to discuss it, all the time,'' he
says.
 this  latest match, though, will likely be a joyful one with few
hard  feelings by the losers, russian coach alexander kabanov said.
the  battle is for both nations' return to water polo's elite.
''this  year is 2000,'' said hungarian coach denes kemeny. ''the
difficulty  we face is the strength of the russian team.''
hungary  holds an olympic-record six water polo golds. but its
program  has faltered in international competition the past two
decades.  its last gold was in 1976, and its last medal was a bronze
four  years later.
hungary  rebounded from an earlier tournament loss to yugoslavia
in  its 8-7 semifinal victory. ''i think we beat the best team in
the  olympics,'' hungary's kasas said.
russia  was also a water polo superpower as the soviet union. it
won  gold in 1972 and 1980, then earned consecutive bronze medals in
1988  as the soviet union and in 1992 as the unified team.
the  crumbling soviet republic splintered its water polo talent,

[HEADLINE] :  winners &amp; losers as e-zpass, toll hike debut on n.j. turnpike
[TEXT]
woodbridge,  n.j. (ap) - saturday was a day of winners and losers
on  the new jersey turnpike.
clay  daniel was a winner. out with his family on a gorgeous fall
morning  for a trip to new york, he was able to sail through the
toll  booths unobstructed, saving at least 20 minutes on his drive
because  he had an e-zpass tag attached to his windshield on the
first  day the turnpike began using the electronic toll collection
system.
 but  cornelius wade was one of the day's losers. an independent
long-haul  trucker, he found himself hit with a steep toll hike that
will  further eat into the meager earnings he says he's able to
scrape  out. saturday was also the first day of the turnpike's
so-called  ''variable pricing'' toll schedule, in which increases of
20  percent for cars and 13 percent for trucks took effect.
but  cars with e-zpass that avoid entering the turnpike during
the  peak hours of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4:30 to 6 p.m. won't have to pay
an  increase. during peak hours and weekends, the increase for these
vehicles  will be 8 percent. trucks with e-zpass will pay an 8
percent  increase regardless of when they use the toll road. it was
the  first phase of a multistage increase that will eventually raise
tolls  by 37 percent for cash customers, and 18 percent for e-zpass
users  by the year 2003.
needless  to say, there was confusion on the road as motorists
zigged  and zagged, trying to end up in the correct lane, trying to
figure  out how much they'd have to pay based on what time it was.
''it's  going to take some getting used to on the part of the
public,''  said lynn fleeger, a spokeswoman for the new jersey
turnpike  authority. ''for 50 years, there was only one way to pay
tolls,  and that was with cash. now there's different options.''
e-zpass  went online about 4 a.m. by 11 a.m., it had already
processed  36,000 transactions.
''it's  going very well,'' fleeger said. ''from a system
standpoint,  it's performing extremely well. there's still some
confusion  out there on the part of motorists, but we're pleased
with  the way the transactions are going.''
so  was daniel. the wilmington, del., man was out with his family
on  a trip to new york, loving the speed with which he sailed
through  the entrance tolls at exit 1 near the delaware memorial
bridge.
 ''i  love it,'' he said during a quick stopover at the grover
cleveland  rest area just north of exit 11 in woodbridge. ''i'm
thrilled  they started using it. you can go all the way from
delaware  to new york state now without having to dig for change or
take  out your wallet.''
''it  makes things so fast,'' said judy aldeghi of haddon
heights.  ''it probably saves you 5 or 10 minutes on each trip.''
but  those without e-zpass were less chipper saturday. lines of
30  or more vehicles queued up in front of some cash-only toll
booths,  while drivers seethed as they watched e-zpass-equipped cars
zip  right by them.
''at  exit 12 in carteret, it's terrible,'' said darlene deberry,
who  lives in carteret. ''it backs up halfway down the turnpike
sometimes.  i'm going to tell my son and my boyfriend to get
(e-zpass).  it might save you 20 minutes of waiting in traffic.''
and  the toll hike wasn't winning any plaudits, either. wade, the
independent  trucker from bridgeport, conn., was so angry he could
hardly  speak.
''jersey  is getting as bad as new york,'' he fumed. ''they
should  chop it off and let it drift off in the water. this is
another  nightmare, especially with what us truckers have to go
through.
 ''tolls  are too high to start with,'' he said. ''we're forced to
use  this road every day because we've been forced off the smaller
roads.  it makes it harder to make a living.''
wade  said he paid about $200 a week before the toll increase
took  effect, on top of $400 a week in fuel costs, plus maintenance
expenses  for his two $155,000 trucks. wade, who was hauling a load
of  steel from philadelphia to massachusetts, vowed to try to avoid
the  turnpike as much as possible.
''you  can't pass the increases on to your customers,'' he said.
''they  don't want to hear it. they don't care that it costs me 13
percent  more to drive this road now. they'll just say, 'take a
different  road; that's on you.' ''
another  trucker who would not give his name said the higher
tolls  would force him to break the law by carrying heavier loads
than  permitted, and lying about it on his documents.
''it's  going to make me become a bigger criminal, to load extra
weight  and run illegal,'' he said. ''it costs x amount to run this
truck.  if tolls go up, there's only one other place you can make up
for  it. i think lots of other trucks are going to do the same
thing,  too.''
the  turnpike will dedicate 120 lanes as permanent e-zpass lanes,
and  they'll stay in the same spots at toll plazas, fleeger said. an
additional  41 can be added or removed as demand dictates. e-zpass
lanes  are marked by purple overhead signs with flashing yellow
lights.
 fleeger  said there are no plans for now to add pavement markings
to  help motorists line up for cash or e-zpass lanes.
''we  want to see how our positioning works out first,'' she
said.

[HEADLINE] :  u.s. men clown during anthem
[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- ''oh, say can you see'' is about to
become  ''did you see what they did?''
so  what should we make of the hugging, mugging, preening,
flexing,  posing, clowning display by maurice greene and his posse --
jon  drummond, bernard williams and brian lewis -- during the
national  anthem?
nothing.
 it  was a ''look-at-me thing,'' the kind of thing too many
athletes  do nowadays because they get paid and worshipped all out
of  proportion for doing one thing exceptionally.
over  the top?
undoubtedly.
 in  poor taste?
certainly.
 disrespectful?
 probably  not.
you  would know that if you had seen the look on their faces the
moment  it dawned on the four members of the gold medal-winning u.s.
men's  400-meter relay team how poorly their ''celebration'' was
going  to be received in the states.
that  moment occurred during a news conference a half-hour after
the  four collected their hardware, not long after a reporter read
back  comments by nanceen perry, a member of the u.s. women's
400-meter  relay team.
perry  watched her compatriots' celebration on a tv screen a few
minutes  after she'd stood on the same podium herself.
''the  whole way they were going about it, making all sorts of
comical  faces -- you could do a little bit of that, but they were
doing  it throughout the national anthem,'' perry said.
''how  do you expect anybody to respect our flag if you don't. i
think  foreigners think we're rude, anyway, so it just confirms the
whole  image they have of us.''
when  first read back to drummond, those remarks didn't quite
drain  the bravado out of his face, or even his posture. initially,
drummond  wasn't stunned enough to quit the annoying habit of
discussing  himself in the third person.
''jon  drummond never won an olympic gold before,'' drummond
said,  ''so sorry.''
drummond  was slouching when he said this, but then greene,
sitting  to his right, came across with an apology that sounded
sincere.
 ''i'm  sorry,'' greene said, his voice even, ''if we offended
anybody.''
 anybody  who knows greene knows how hard it must have been to get
those  few words out.
greene  is irritating on good days, so much of a peacock that his
vanity  plates back home read ''mo gold.'' he woofs and talks so
much  trash that even his pal and training partner, ato boldon of
trinidad,  often shakes his head at the crazy things that come out
of  greene's mouth.
but  boldon also knows, better than the rest of us, this is how
some  men pump themselves up to run 100 meters in less than 10
seconds  in front of 110,000 screaming people -- when years of hard
work  can be undone by one false step.
and  once drummond realized greene was on the level, he sat
straight  up and tried to explain how it felt to get it all right --
and  win.
''you  have a lot of emotion bottled up,'' drummond said. ''your
focus  is on one thing for so long. when we finally have that
opportunity  to exhale, we're just expressing ourselves the way we
know  how.''
williams  sat to greene's right and lewis to the right of him.
apparently,  greene's apology covered them, too.
good  thing that, because this is a fight these guys will never
win.  people back home will see them for a few moments on tv and
think  what michael johnson and a whole lot of their elders here
did.
 johnson  has an ugly feud already going with greene and he didn't
actually  see the celebration, probably because he was preparing for
his  own trip to the medals podium.
but  it didn't take long for accounts to get back to him. or for
johnson  to pass judgment.
''i'm  sure that what you all saw, that i didn't see, is a
product,  another product of that immaturity,'' he said.
that  was a contributing factor, no doubt. but this wasn't
roseanne  barr singing the national anthem before a baseball game in
san  diego, spitting and grabbing her crotch like a ballplayer. and
it  wasn't a political statement, a black-gloved, black power salute
by  john carlos and tommie smith on the podium in mexico city in
1968.
 this  was four guys letting off nervous energy. four guys who
should  have been able to find a less provocative way to do it. they
couldn't.  still, bad taste isn't a capital offense.
all  that needs to be said was said by antonio pettigrew, another
member  of the 1,600 relay team with johnson. asked what advice he
had  for lewis, the youngest member of the 400 crew, pettigrew
replied:
 ''what  i would say to bernard is, 'sometimes, don't get caught
up  in the moment. you represent the u.s.a. it's a bigger spectrum
than  here. it's all around the world.''

[HEADLINE] :  priest attacks ill. abortion clinic
[TEXT]
rockford,  ill. (ap) -- a catholic priest smashed his car into an
abortion  clinic saturday morning, then chopped at the building with
an  ax until the owner fired two shotgun blasts to stop him, police
said.
 the  clinic was not open and nobody was injured in the attack,
which  came just two days after federal approval of the abortion
pill  ru-486.
the  man drove through a door at the abortion access northern
illinois  women's center around 8:15 a.m. he was swinging an ax when
the  clinic's owner fired a 12-gauge shotgun twice. he did not hit
the  man.
the  rev. john earl, 32, was arrested and charged with burglary
and  felony criminal damage to property, said deputy police chief
dominic  iasparro. earl was being held in lieu of $10,000 bail.
iasparro  would not comment on statements earl made to police
about  a possible motive.
abortion  providers usually are on alert for violence following
abortion-related  events in the news, such as this week's approval
of  ru-486 by the u.s. food and drug administration, said vicki
saporta,  executive director of the national abortion federation.
''we  haven't received any specific threats, but anytime abortion
is  in the headlines we issue an alert to our clinics to take
precautions  because there is the potential for increased
violence,''  she said.
the  rockford clinic is not one of the naf's 360 member
facilities,  but ''it's just kind of common sense that clinics would
be  on alert,'' she said.
earl  did not reach the clinic offices with the ax, so damage was
confined  to the exterior overhead door he crashed through and
woodwork  in a hallway, iasparro said.
the  clinic houses the office of dr. richard ragsdale.
ragsdale  said there have been vocal protests outside the clinic
during  the past four or five months, but he said he had not noticed
earl.
 ''i'm  not surprised that something happened on the heels of the
ru-486  announcement,'' he said. ''but this is a little more violent
than  we were expecting.''
ragsdale  said the clinic will open as scheduled monday.
ragsdale  filed a landmark 1983 lawsuit challenging illinois
abortion  restrictions, contending that they required doctors
performing  abortions to conduct their practices in buildings that
in  effect are hospitals. under a settlement that was upheld by the
u.s.  supreme court in 1990, women fewer than 18 weeks pregnant may
undergo  abortions in clinics, while those beyond that term require
full-service  surgical facilities.
rockford  is located about 85 miles northwest of chicago.

[HEADLINE] :  va. parking decks probed after crash
[TEXT]
virginia  beach, va. (ap) -- officials have ordered safety
inspections  of the city's older parking structures after a car
plunged  off the top deck of a hotel parking garage this week,
killing  four vacationers.
the  city had said owners were responsible for checking their
parking  decks.
''but  after careful consideration, this is the way we think it
ought  to be done,'' planning director robert scott said. ''we feel
a  response from the city is in order.''
the  four women killed sunday worked as nurses at new york's st.
vincent's  hospital and medical center. their car crashed through a
3-foot  retaining wall at the sandcastle resort hotel, flipped and
landed  on its roof 41 feet below.
the  top floor of the sandcastle's parking garage did not have
wheel  guards, a requirement when the parking garage was built 15
years  ago, according to the illinois-based building officials and
code  administrators international, or boca.
boca  drafts construction codes that carry the force of law in
virginia  and many other states. cities and counties are charged
with  enforcing the standards.
a  spokesman for sandcastle refused to comment.
richard  maddox, chairman of the resort leadership council, which
represents  a large faction of oceanfront district businesses, said
hotel  owners and managers would support ''anything and everything
it  would take to create a safe environment.''

[HEADLINE] :  russia researchers back from arctic
[TEXT]
moscow  (ap) -- russia's continental shelf may be bigger than
previously  believed, researchers said saturday upon return from the
country's  first major state-sponsored expedition to the arctic sea
since  the soviet era.
the  ship academic fyodorov returned saturday to the northern
port  of murmansk after a six-week journey, the itar-tass news
agency  reported.
vladimir  kryukov, director of the state-run company that led the
expedition,  said the results of research in the area of the
mendeleyev  rise ''could be a serious argument for expanding
russia's  continental shelf'' by more than 480,000 square miles,
pending  u.n. approval, itar-tass said.
kryukov  said the ship studied areas that previous researchers
had  not been able to reach, and that it was russia's first such
large-scale  expedition in nine years. the report did not explain
what  the researchers found.
russia  is already the world's largest country in land mass.
the  trip was sponsored by the defense ministry, the natural
resources  ministry and the state meteorological agency.

[HEADLINE] :  african triangle may get troops
[TEXT]
monrovia,  liberia (ap) -- west african peacekeeping troops may
soon  be deployed along the borders of liberia, sierra leone and
guinea  to prevent war in the increasingly tense triangle, sierra
leone's  vice president said saturday.
albert  joseph denby said presidents of the 16-member economic
community  of west african states were ''working on'' stationing
peacekeepers  in the region to halt sporadic cross-border raids and
prevent  an escalation of hostilities. no final decision had been
taken  yet, he added.
denby  made the remarks to journalists in monrovia following
private  talks with liberian president charles taylor in gbarnga,
some  125 miles to the northeast.
relations  between the three nations have chilled in recent weeks
and  military activity along the borders have increased following a
crackdown  by guinea on hundreds of thousands of refugees who have
taken  shelter in that country from wars in liberia and sierra
leone.
 denby  did not reveal details of his discussions with taylor but
said  he delivered a special letter from sierra leone president
ahmed  tejan kabbah.
''nobody  is satisfied with events in the subregion,'' denby
said,  adding that taylor was ''happy to see me.''
guinea  accuses the refugees of being behind dissident attacks on
several  guinean villages while liberia counters that one of its own
rebel  groups uses rear bases in guinea to stage attacks on northern
liberia.
 the  economic community of west african states has sent
peacekeepers  to the past in both liberia and sierra leone, where
some  13,000 u.n. troops are stationed to salvage a lapsed peace
agreement  involving sierra leone's government and a notoriously
brutal  rebel group.

[HEADLINE] :  dutch doctor sought in canada
[TEXT]
dartmouth,  nova scotia (ap) -- police have issued an arrest
warrant  for a dutch doctor who is accused of illegally storing
children's  organs in a canadian warehouse.
the  warrant was issued friday after workers discovered eight
organs  thought to belong to two 5-year-old children in a crate
abandoned  at the facility two years ago.
the  doctor, pathologist dick van velzen, was in the netherlands
on  saturday. he is also the target of an inquiry into the
stockpiling  of children's organs at a british university.
police  in canada said they were concerned about the way the
organs  were stored, said judy pal, spokeswoman for the halifax
police.  they do not suspect foul play in the children's deaths.
''the  way they were left there and the way he left them in the
hands  of warehouse workers, we have some serious concerns,'' she
said.
 the  doctor is charged with indecent interference with a dead
body,  which carries a five-year prison sentence, she said.
van  velzen released a statement from the hague saying he had
stored  only human tissues in the canadian warehouse, pal said, and
would  call halifax police to discuss the matter.
van  velzen ran the pathology department at a halifax children's
hospital  for two years, until he was fired in 1998.
the  inquiry in britain was launched in november 1999 after alder
hey  children's hospital in liverpool learned that hundreds of
children's  organs were being stored in a university of liverpool
laboratory.

reggio  calabria, italy (ap) -- authorities declared a state of
emergency  in italy's southern region of calabria on saturday after
rain  triggered scattered flooding and mudslides.
authorities  evacuated 400 people from homes in the town of
bovalino,  one of several villages in the region fully or partially
isolated  by the rains and mud.
no  injuries were immediately reported.
the  inundation blocked highways and interrupted rail traffic
across  the region, at one spot because of a collapsed pillar on a
railway  trestle. aviation officials briefly closed the airport in
the  calabria capital of reggio calabria.
rain  caused trouble across much of northern and central italy as
well  saturday, with a record 14 inches of rain in 24 hours reported
in  the piedmont region. high water flooded st. mark's piazza in

olive  branch, miss. (ap) -- two buses and a van carrying
clark-atlanta  university students to an out-of-state football game
collided  saturday, sending at least 130 people to area hospitals,
police  said.
no  one was killed, and the injuries were not considered
life-threatening.
 the  wreck occurred about 9 a.m. about 12 miles south of memphis,
tenn.,  olive branch police sgt. bill sanders said.
sanders  said traffic had been slowed on the highway because
officers  were cleaning up debris from an 18-wheeler crash that
occurred  before dawn.
''the  lead bus had to stop due to traffic. the second bus veered
to  left to avoid an accident, but the third bus struck the van,
which  in turn ran into the first bus,'' sanders said.
the  vehicles were carrying cheerleaders, university band
members,  and fans traveling to memphis for clark-atlanta's game
against  lane college on saturday night.
police  said those who were not hurt were placed on the second
bus  to continue the trip.
sanders  said the accident was cleaned up about noon and the road

[HEADLINE] :  croat president retires 7 generals
[TEXT]
zagreb,  croatia (ap) -- the president of croatia retired seven
generals  who were critical of the government's plan to prosecute
alleged  war criminals. the country's former ruling party responded
saturday  by calling for new elections.
veterans  of the 1991 war for independence from yugoslavia joined
in  the storm of criticism over president stipe mesic's move, which
followed  an open letter by 12 active-duty and retired generals
criticizing  cooperation with the u.n. war crimes tribunal.
in  a statement, the croatian democratic union, led by former
president  franjo tudjman until his death in december last year,
denounced  the government as ''communist and anti-croat.''
it  said the government ''will be overthrown with the only
civilized  weapon -- by the will of the people expressed in the
elections,  this time early parliamentary elections, which have to
be  called as soon as possible.''
mesic,  who fired the seven active-duty generals friday, brushed
off  the tudjman party, saying it ''obviously forgot that the power
can  only be seized by democratic means.''
all  12 were strong tudjman's supporters and are regarded by some
here  as war heroes.
prime  minister ivica racan also dismissed the party statement,
saying  that it ''is directed not only against this government, but
against  all people of croatia.''
''croatian  citizens gave their votes on jan. 3 to this
government  for the next four years,'' he said, reaffirming
determination  to carry out reforms and establish the state of law.
war  veterans called on mesic to reconsider the decision and said
they  would support the generals ''now, as we did in the war.''
the  new government has tried to cooperate with the u.n. war
crimes  tribunal and prosecute those accused of atrocities against
serbs  and muslims during the balkan wars.
however,  senior officers and war veterans accuse the government
of  shaming the nation's 1991 struggle for independence against
yugoslavia.
 opposition  to the government's moves erupted this month when
police  arrested several croats suspected of committing war crimes
against  serbs.

[HEADLINE] :  colo. ruling frees sex offenders
[TEXT]
denver  (ap) -- prison officials have released 170 rapists and
child  molesters from parole, and 112 other sex offenders also could
be  freed following a colorado supreme court ruling.
the  state's highest court threw out a 1993 mandatory parole law
because  it conflicted with a 1979 measure that limited how long sex
offenders  could be placed on parole.
in  coming years, 600 sex offenders sentenced from 1993 to 1998
to  prison and parole will be released without having to serve
parole,  department of corrections administrator donna thurlow said
friday.
 the  sept. 18 ruling came in the case of vance martin, who was
sentenced  to five years of probation after pleading guilty in 1994
to  sexual assault on a child. after two probation violations, he
was  re-sentenced in 1997 to four years in prison and five years of
mandatory  parole based on the 1993 law.
state  lawmakers said they would study the issue when the
legislature  convenes in january.

[HEADLINE] :  white house urges calm on jerusalem
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- the clinton administration appealed for calm
saturday  in violence-wracked jerusalem, saying that the highly
charged  issue of the city's future must be solved ''at the
negotiating  table and not in the streets.''
a  dozen palestinians were reported killed and 523 wounded as
israeli  police battled several gunmen and thousands of
rockthrowers.
 ''we  are very concerned about the violence,'' secretary of state
madeleine  albright said in iceland, one stop in her european trip.
''it  is clearly counterproductive in the peace process. there is
danger  of a cycle of violence developing. the talks are at a very
delicate  stage and it is important that the violence stops.''
she  said that she had telephoned both yasser arafat, the
palestinian  leader, and israeli prime minister ehud barak in an
effort  to ease tensions.
the  trigger for the violence was a dispute over a bitterly
contested  jerusalem shrine sacred to muslims and jews. six
palestinians  were killed and almost 200 were injured in clashes at
the  compound on friday.
in  washington, p.j. crowley of the white house's national
security  council said, ''we recognize that emotions are running
high  but these remain issues that must be resolved at the
negotiating  table and not in the streets.''
he  said u.s. officials had been ''in touch with both sides at
the  highest levels, urging them to do all that they can to work
together  to restore calm.''

[HEADLINE] :  truth is elusive in airline death
[TEXT]
somewhere  behind the pale stone facade of the fbi building in
salt  lake city, the transcript from a cockpit voice recorder and a
thick  sheaf of interview notes hold clues to why a 19-year-old was
killed  by fellow airline passengers.
unless  jonathan burton's mother decides to sue, she may never
know  exactly what happened to her son aboard southwest airlines
flight  1763 from las vegas. he went berserk and was pummeled,
wrestled  into the aisle and held down so tight he couldn't breathe.
so  far, the more janet burton has learned, the more she has
questioned.
 little  about burton's last hour alive is sure. what follows is
the  best reconstruction possible to date, pieced together by the
associated  press from interviews with passengers, police, the fbi,
airline  officials, burton's mother and sections of the autopsy
report  she gave to reporters.
airport  police also supplied written statements from two
officers  who met the flight at salt lake city international just
after  11 p.m. on aug. 11.
accounts  differ, each influenced by vantage point, tainted by
media  reports or confused by panic.
------
 jonathan  burton was headed to salt lake to spend two weeks with
his  aunt and uncle. it was a trip he and his older brothers had
made  almost every summer since they were kids. during the week,
they'd  work at their uncle's painting business. water skiing and
hiking  ruled the weekends. in more recent years, the brothers often
went  separately, and this year, burton was traveling alone.
he  was getting ready to start community college after taking a
year  off. he had worked in housekeeping for a nursing home and last
year  was voted employee of the month, but wiping floors got old. he
still  wasn't sure what he wanted to do, but school would be a good
start.
 the  evening he was leaving, the tv news carried something about
a  plane crash. mrs. burton remembers saying it seemed like anytime
someone's  about to get on a plane, they hear about something going
wrong.
 ''yeah,''  her son said, ''isn't that something?''
they  headed for the airport and grabbed some tacos on the way.
mrs.  burton waited with her son at the gate until he boarded.
''i  love you,'' he said.
''see  you in two weeks,'' she replied.
carrying  a new book about how to win at blackjack, burton walked
onboard.
 ------
 adam  bradshaw jogged to the gate. his late flight from burbank,
calif.,  had almost cost him his las vegas connection to salt lake.
he  was headed for a new job and didn't want to miss the flight.
plus,  he didn't have a seat assignment on southwest, which does
things  first-come, first-serve.
management  consultant dave jennings, on his way home from
business  in los angeles, found a seat two rows in front of burton
and  tucked his laptop between his feet. dean harvey, on vacation
from  canada, settled in near the front.
bradshaw  found a spot toward the back. john whitaker, on his way
home,  was in an aisle seat nearby.
at  9:20 p.m., the boeing 737 lifted off over the sparkling
lights  of las vegas. it was behind schedule, but the captain said
he  could make it up. he told the 121 passengers they'd be in salt
lake  on time.
the  jet reached its cruising altitude, and the three flight
attendants  began serving drinks. that's when bradshaw first noticed
burton,  a young man in jeans and a t-shirt, wearing a baseball cap
backward.  he had brown hair, a goatee -- and a frantic look.
as  a flight attendant was about to serve bradshaw, burton
strolled  up, took a drink off the tray and returned to his seat
without  a word. ''away he went,'' bradshaw said, ''kind of
self-serve.''
 the  flight attendant told burton he should have waited for
someone  to take his order, but he didn't seem to pay attention.
a  few minutes later, he was on his feet again, this time headed
to  the rear. he rummaged through cabinets until he found the
peanuts,  grabbed a couple packs and returned again to his seat.
jennings  recalls thinking the guy must work for southwest.
another  passenger thought otherwise.
''fifty-one-50,''  the man behind bradshaw muttered. a television
news  director, bradshaw recognized the police catch phrase for
somebody  mentally unstable. bradshaw turned to his fellow passenger
and  said, ''i wonder what we're in for.''
several  minutes passed. suddenly burton got up and began pacing
the  aisle. he walked all the way to the front, all the way to the
back,  and then again toward the nose of the plane.
whitaker  thought he was looking for an open lavatory, but he
also  saw the glassy, agitated look on burton's face. he must really
have  to go, whitaker thought.
''when  he walked past me, he was mumbling and he seemed
anxious,''  whitaker said. ''he seemed stressed.''
then  burton raised his voice and kicked the folding door to the
cockpit,  hard. an emergency escape panel popped out and burton
shoved  his head and shoulders through the opening, muttering
something  like, ''fly this plane.'' people started to get scared.
six-feet-tall  and about 190 pounds, burton was muscular and
ruggedly  good-looking, bearing a slight resemblance in some family
photographs  to actor brad pitt. he had played baseball as a boy and
wrestled  at cheyenne high school. it showed.
it  ''looked like he was intent on going in there,'' said harvey,
the  canadian. ''but it looked like the pilots were intent on
pushing  him out.''
and  they did.
what  the heck is he going to do, harvey wondered. is he going to
pull  out a weapon? is he going to hijack the plane? what the hell
is  going on?
a  flight attendant urged burton to calm down. its unclear
whether  he then returned to a seat alone or if passengers forced
him  that way. in the end, a group of men surrounded him in an exit
row.
 somebody  yelled he was going for the handle. men and women
scrambled  over seats to get away. children started screaming. a
flight  attendant asked volunteers to stand in front of the broken
cockpit  door.
a  few men hung on to burton as he squirmed, then he seemed to
get  a hold of himself and sat down. the curious peeked up over seat
backs  to get a better look.
''settle  down, settle down, chill out,'' people told him.
''stupid  jerk,'' someone added.
burton  still had a sort of spacey look on his face, and each
time  one of his self-appointed guards glanced away, burton wriggled
a  little more.
it  wasn't over.
as  the plane began its descent into salt lake, burton exploded
again,  jumping up, spitting on people and landing punches like he
knew  how. kids were shrieking, old women hid their eyes. several
men  fought with burton. one wound up with a split lip. they grabbed
his  arms and legs, stretched him out and mashed him on the floor.
four  guys stood or sat on his limbs.
at  some point the pilot came on the intercom, telling passengers
they  were close to landing. he said he hoped all of them -- but one
--  would have a good weekend. its unclear whether this came before
or  after burton's second outburst.
jennings  couldn't see very well but remembers seeing burton on
the  floor, sort of under a seat. he says some passengers were
yelling  things like, ''hurt him! beat him up!''
''they  were scared. it felt like he was taking over the plane,''
jennings  explained.
only  he has publicly reported hearing shouts egging on a fight.
and  only harvey has given what may be the most disturbing part of
the  story. he says that in the end, it wasn't burton doing the
fighting.
 harvey  remembers the young man being subdued as some passengers
continued  to beat him.
''i  couldn't understanding why this was continuing,'' harvey
said.  ''he was basically 100 percent defenseless at this time. ...
i  remember thinking no one can take a pounding like this.''
harvey  says he went down the aisle as a big man in black boots --
weighing  as much as 260 pounds -- repeatedly kicked burton.
''i  felt this group, particularly this one man, was out of
control,''  harvey said. ''he was stomping on jonathan's chest, one
foot  at a time, i don't know what the rest of the group was doing
other  than holding him.''
harvey  begged for it to stop, but finally returned to his seat
and  told his companion, ''i think they're killing him back there.''
------
 one  of the first police officers to board the plane reported
finding  burton unconscious and bleeding from the mouth with a
''huge  knot'' and ''discoloration'' on his forehead.
the  time is imprecise, somewhere between 11 and 11:30 p.m.
at  first, fbi agent bill matthews thought he had gone into
cardiac  arrest. burton's behavior seemed consistent with drug use,
and  his heart could have stopped if he was doped up enough to act
crazy.
 it  would be weeks before his mother learned her son had
suffocated  as the other travelers restrained him.
that  night, police handcuffed the motionless body as people
warned  burton would fight if he came around. paramedics tended to
bloody  passengers and to burton, but he was declared dead just
after  midnight at a local hospital.
airport  police took passenger names, and some filled out written
forms  for southwest. others left without talking to authorities.
members  of the flight crew went to a local hotel and had to be
brought  back to the airport later that night for questioning by the
fbi.  the airline has declined to make their names public.
linda  rutherford, of southwest, said the company cooperated
fully  with authorities and believes crew members handled the
situation  as well as possible.
''the  flight crew did absolutely what they thought was necessary
in  response to mr. burton's behavior,'' she said.
autopsy  results, some which were released to various news
outlets  by burton's family, showed signs of drug use, but
authorities  don't think it was enough to cause the man's apparent
break  with reality.
the  autopsy also reportedly recorded that burton had contusions
and  abrasions on his torso, face and neck, and died after being
suffocated.  the death has been ruled a homicide, but u.s. attorney
paul  m. warner has decided not to file charges. warner issued a
statement  saying the passengers acted in self-defense. he declined
to  be interviewed by the associated press.
mrs.  burton says she can't understand any of it.
''that  wasn't jonathan. it's just nothing like jonathan. he
would  never go looking for a fight.''
now,  she's just hoping someone else will come forward to help
her  figure things out.
''i  can appreciate the fact of passengers being scared. if i'd
been  a passenger, i would have been scared,'' she said.
''but  jonathan needed to be safely restrained. he should have
been  in a salt lake city jail if he caused a problem on that plane.
they  had no right to be judge, jury and executioner.''

[TEXT]
sydney,  australia (ap) -- it's become a sort of american olympic
ritual:  a trip to the gold medal stand followed by an appearance on
a  cereal box.
kellogg  co. announced sunday (saturday edt) that it will put the
faces  of four prominent u.s. gold medal winners on boxes of
breakfast  cereals.
sprinters  maurice greene and marion jones and backstroke swimmer
lenny  krayzelburg will join tony the tiger on boxes of frosted
flakes,  while swimmer jenny thompson will be featured on boxes of
crispix.
 all  four had signed contracts with kellogg before the olympics --
preempting  any plans general mills might have had to lure them over
to  the arch-rival wheaties camp.
kellogg  is an official supplier of the u.s. olympic team through
the  2004 summer games in athens.
------
 first  gold: the words had never been uttered before at an
olympics.  maybe that's why the players weren't sure how to react.
''gold  medalists: cameroon.''
the  crowd at the olympic stadium cheered, but the players on the
soccer  team hesitated and looked at each other. finally, they
realized  that this was the moment they were supposed to step
forward  onto the round, gold-colored podiums and accept their
medals  from international olympic committee president juan antonio
samaranch.
 cameroon  won the olympic soccer tournament saturday, beating
spain  on penalty kicks after a 2-2 tie. cameroon's olympic history
had  previously consisted of just two medals, both in boxing: a
silver  in mexico city in 1968 and a bronze in los angeles in 1984.
------
 at  long last: bahamians waving flags and cheering in drenching
rain  celebrated the country's first gold medal in 36 years and its
first  in track and field with the women's 400 relay victory
saturday.
 the  race ended around 4:30 a.m. bahamas time, but that did not
stop  people from cheering ''we won!'' in the streets. even police
officers  in squad cars honked their horns and waved flags, waking
some  people in nassau.
''i  didn't care,'' georgette hall, a 23-year-old mother, said of
the  early awakening. ''every bahamian should be proud of the girls.
they  are our girls. we love all of them.''
the  bahamian team of davis-thompson, sevetheda fynes, chandra
sturrup  and debbie ferguson finished with a time of 41.95.
the  bahamas won its first -- and until saturday, only -- gold
medal  in sailing in the 1964 tokyo olympics. when davis-thompson
took  the 200 meter silver this week, islanders were proud but
showed  little fanfare. the capture of the elusive gold brought fans
out  into the rainy streets of nassau.
''when  i heard the national anthem playing on tv i cried like a
baby,''  said marsha johnson, a 33-year old banker. ''it was great
moment.  i couldn't talk. i couldn't move. i am getting goosebumps
just  talking about it.''
------
 call  to the flags: olympics organizers on saturday urged
sydney  residents not to steal thousands of flags hanging in the
city  ahead of the paralympics.
more  than 10,000 of the colorful banners have been hung along
sydney  streets during the olympics and are due to stay until after
the  oct. 18-29 paralympics.
wheelchair  athlete louise sauvage said it would be a
disappointment  if the banners had been stolen before the
paralympics  began. ''i remember arriving in atlanta four years ago
after  the olympics ended and things had been pulled down and ripped
down,''  she said.
------
 derailed:  a train derailment caused minor disruption late
saturday  on services to olympic park, with commuters having to wait
an  extra 20 minutes for a ride to and from the main competition
sites.
 a  train went off the tracks at the flemington railyard in
western  sydney at 7 p.m (4 a.m. edt), according to the olympic
roads  and transport authority.
there  were no passengers on board and the train was quickly
removed  from the tracks.

[TEXT]
ann  arbor, mich. (ap) -- drew henson, making his first start,
threw  a 17-yard touchdown pass to david terrell with 6:42 left to
give  no. 9 michigan a 13-10 victory over no. 17 wisconsin on
saturday.
 the  wolverines (4-1 overall, 2-0 big ten) became the first
division  i-a football program to reach 800 wins.
the  badgers (3-2, 0-2) likely eliminated themselves from winning
a  third straight big ten title. since 1896, a big ten championship
has  been won by a team with two losses just four times.
henson,  who fumbled twice in the first quarter, was 15-of-27 for
257  yards and a touchdown.
on  the game-winning drive, henson converted on two third downs
with  a 21 and 20-yard passes to terrell. on the game-winning pass,
henson  eluded a rush, rolled right and threw across the field on
his  back foot, over two defenders and one of his receivers, to a
leaping  terrell in the back of the end zone.
henson  made his first college start after missing the first
three  games of the season because of a broken foot, and coming off
the  bench last week to lead the wolverines to victory at illinois.
marquise  walker caught seven passes for 130 yards, terrell had
five  receptions for 96 yards, and anthony thomas gained 82 yards on
29  carries.
wisconsin's  michael bennett ran for 123 yards on 30 carries.
brooks  bollinger was 8-of-17 for 98 yards with one touchdown and
two  first-quarter interceptions. bollinger scrambled for 57 yards
on  12 attempts.
michigan  needed the go-ahead touchdown after wisconsin took a
10-6  lead with 12:10 left. on a play-action pass, bollinger tossed
a  5-yard pass to chad kuhns to finish a 13-play, 71-yard drive,
which  took 5:47.
both  quarterbacks had trouble taking care of the football,
especially  in the first quarter. in the first 12:21, henson fumbled
twice  and bollinger threw two interceptions.
michigan's  todd howard prevented wisconsin from scoring a
touchdown  on its first drive by cutting in front of nick davis in
the  end zone on the first interception.
the  badgers turned henson's first fumble into a score. kevin
stemke  kicked a 49-yard field goal to give wisconsin a 3-0 lead
with  4:26 left in the fist quarter.
jeff  del verne tied it with a 33-yard field goal with four
seconds  left in the half. henson directed a nine-play, 57-yard
drive  over 1:09, highlighted by a 33-yard pass to terrell, to get
in  position to score.
del  verne put michigan ahead 6-3 on another 33-yard field goal
midway  through the third quarter.
henson  played in an entire game for the first time.
in  last week's 35-31 win at illinois, he directed the final
possession  of the first half and the entire second. he missed the
first  three games of the season recovering from a stress fracture
in  his right foot.

[TEXT]
annapolis,  md. (ap) -- ladainian tomlinson ran for 121 yards and
a  touchdown as no. 16 tcu beat navy 24-0 on saturday to extend its
winning  streak to nine games.
casey  printers was 14-of-17 for 188 yards and two touchdowns for
the  horned frogs (4-0). navy fell to 0-4.
tomlinson,  who had 33 carries, broke tcu's career rushing
record,  pushing his total to 3,645 yards.
tcu  put together touchdown drives of 81, 85 and 67 yards, keyed
by  printers' passing. the 81-yard march in the second quarter ended
with  matt schobel's 9-yard catch. schobel also had a 13-yarder in
the  drive, and printers hit cedric james for 27 yards
tomlinson,  who had only 13 yards in the first touchdown drive,
scored  the second td on a 4-yard run. he ran for 24 yards, while
printers  completed four passes for 45 yards, in the 85-yard march.
fullback  george layne, who had a 20-yard burst in the first
scoring  drive, added a 27-yard run on the final play of the third
quarter.  that drive finished with a 23-yard pass from printers to
layne  that made it 24-0 with 14:12 remaining.
layne  finished with 78 yards on seven carries.
navy's  longest drive took the midshipmen to the tcu 13. but a
penalty  moved them back 5 yards, and they ended up missing a field
goal  in the closing seconds of the first half.
the  midshipmen were held to 120 yards total offense, and crossed
midfield  only twice. tcu has not allowed a touchdown in its last
eight  quarters, while navy has been blanked for six periods.

[HEADLINE] :  deaths rising in south asia floods
[TEXT]
pairadanga,  india (ap) -- torrential rains and deadly floods in
india  and bangladesh have cast a cruel twist on the region's
biggest  hindu festival that ordinarily would be marked with
frenzied  celebrations and gifts.
during  the durga puja festival, devotees honor durga, the
mythological  goddess thought to bring blessings and save people
from  hardships. the festival is to be held this coming week.
but  the killer floods that in the last two weeks have devastated
much  of west bengal state and part of neighboring bangladesh --
forcing  millions from their homes -- could prove too big a challenge
even  for durga.
''how  can i expect my father to buy a gift for me when we have
lost  our home?'' asked shibani biswas, an eighth-grader who stood
in  a muddy expanse after flood waters receded in pairadanga, a
farming  village 40 miles north of calcutta.
more  than 1,000 people have died, or are missing and presumed
dead,  after unseasonable monsoon rains forced rivers to overflow
across  eastern india and western bangladesh.
the  victims succumbed to drowning, snake bites and murder by
pirates  looting abandoned villages. survivors are battling cholera,
diarrhea  and typhoid that have broken out in crowded relief camps
in  bangladesh.
some  18 million people in both countries are believed to be
marooned.  millions more have seen their meager homes washed away.
churning  flood waters submerged new areas saturday in
bangladesh,  where flood waters inundated farmland and submerged
roads  in 185 villages the day before.
in  calcutta, the state capital of west bengal, weather
specialists  held out hope, saying the hooghly river was returning
to  normal levels after inundating many parts of the region.
hundreds  of villagers throughout the region have been fleeing
their  submerged homes for higher ground on rafts made of banana
trees  tied together with ropes, ferrying all household goods and
small  farm animals they could take with them.
others  wade through waist-high flood water, carrying children
and  the elderly on their shoulders.
''after  the initial chaos we are now getting enough food. but i
wonder  where i shall get the money to rebuild my two damaged
houses?''  asked nitendra shaha, one of 200 people crammed into a
temporary  shelter.
relief  officials in west bengal estimate it will take $65
million  to repair damaged homes; another $714 million to replace
the  value of lost crops.
food  and water are being taken to flood-ravaged districts in the
six  hardest-hit districts of west bengal. but flood victims are
prey  to robbers who raid relief camps and steal supplies.
bangladeshi  prime minister sheikh hasina surveyed the flooded
areas  in a helicopter saturday and visited relief centers in the
worst  hit chuadanga, meherpur and jhenidah districts, the united
news  of bangladesh news agency reported.
''all  assistance will be given to the flood victims,'' hasina
said  at a relief camp in chuadanga, 100 miles east of dhaka. ''none
will  be allowed to die from starvation.''

[TEXT]
philadelphia  (ap) -- gavin hoffman passed for 335 yards and four
touchdowns  saturday as penn defeated dartmouth 48-14 in the ivy
league  opener for both teams.
hoffman  hit on 25 of 29 passes including two scoring strikes
each  to rob milanese and ben zagorski. in three games, hoffman has
now  thrown for 991 yards and 10 touchdowns.
after  dartmouth (0-3) scored on its first possession, a 20-yard
run  by aaron pumerantz, the quakers (2-1) answered with three
touchdowns  in five minutes, to lead 21-7 with 6:04 left in the
first  quarter.
the  margin reached 35-7 at halftime, as hoffman completed 18 of
20  for 230 yards.
the  big green scored their second touchdown with 2:54 remaining
when  greg smith connected with nick murphy on an 11-yard touchdown
throw.
 dartmouth,  which has allowed 132 points this season, now trails
35-31-2  in the all-time series, which began in 1896.

[HEADLINE] :  no. 7 clemson 52, duke 22
[TEXT]
durham,  n.c. (ap) -- no. 7 clemson made the most of its highest
ranking  in nine years.
woodrow  dantzler ran for three touchdowns and threw for another
score  as the undefeated tigers beat winless duke 52-22 on saturday.
clemson  (5-0, 3-0 atlantic coast conference) has won its first
five  games for the first time since 1987 and is 17-3 against the
blue  devils (0-5, 0-2) in the last 20 meetings.
duke  kept it close for awhile, but clemson scored four tds in a
span  of 7:18 in the second quarter to build a 35-0 halftime lead.
the  last three scoring drives of the second quarter each came in
46  seconds or less as the nation's no. 1 offense displayed its
quick-strike  ability under the elusive dantzler, the acc rushing
leader  who ran for 134 yards and passed for 174 more.
it  marked the third straight game dantzler, who didn't play in
the  fourth quarter, has gone over 300 yards of total offense -- a
clemson  record.
while  clemson's offense continued to cruise, duke's was a
disaster  under d. bryant, who was making his first start at qb in
place  of injured spencer romine.
a  57-yard interception return by brian mance set up travis
zachery's  second 1-yard scoring run early in the second and got
clemson  rolling. in addition, the inexperienced bryant was sacked
six  times in the opening 30 minutes as duke was held to 42 total
yards  on 35 plays.
up  21-0 and already having scored on a 12-yard run, dantzler
made  yet another spectacular run that has helped him move into the
heisman  trophy race.
dantzler  faked a pitch and sprinted into the secondary, where he
was  nearly spun to the ground by defensive back darryl scott at the
20.  somehow, dantzler was able to escape, maintain his balance and
race  into the end zone in front of a stunned duke defense.
less  than two minutes later, dantzler hit a wide open morgan
woodward  on an 8-yard scoring pass to put the tigers up by 35.
dantzler  drove the tigers 93 yards midway through the third
quarter  on 13 plays, scoring on a 1-yard dive. dantzler's rushing
yardage  on the long march gave him 520 yards on the ground in the
last  three games -- yet another clemson record by the junior.
the  tigers have now outscored opponents 238-48, while duke has
dropped  52 of its last 64 games since its last bowl season of 1994.

[HEADLINE] :  cops puzzled over drug submarine
[TEXT]
facatativa,  colombia (ap) -- lt. javier uribe, a policeman with a
buzz  cut and a good dose of curiosity, peered through a hole on the
rusted  metal door of the warehouse. in the dim light he spotted
what  looked like huge metal containers.
for  weeks, uribe had been on the trail of thieves who were
digging  down to underground pipelines and stealing gasoline. he
figured  the fuel was being stored in the warehouse, and mounted a
stakeout.
 four  days later, on sept. 6, no one had yet shown up, so the
police  broke into the place.
they  were dumbfounded by what they found.
the  huge metal cylinders were not storage tanks at all -- they
were  sections of a submarine. once completed, it could have ferried
some  150 tons of cocaine to the united states and elsewhere with
almost  no risk of being detected.
colombian  and american law enforcement officials swarmed in on
helicopters  to investigate and also to marvel at the sheer audacity
of  the scheme: to build a submarine 8,000 feet high in the andes
mountains  and then, presumably, truck it at least 210 miles to the
ocean,  section by section.
and  do it all in secret.
------
 a  lanky ''gringo'' who called himself steve smit rented the
warehouse,  in a cow pasture in the bogota suburb of facatativa in
april  1999. smit told manuel neira, the owner, that he wanted to
use  it for a welding shop. soon after, four or five colombians
started  working there.
manuel's  brother pablo lives next door to the warehouse in a
dilapidated  house. he owns two buses that he rents to schools, and
when  he needed to repair them, he would trudge over to the
warehouse  to borrow tools.
at  first the workers obliged, but they never let him peek inside
the  warehouse. after several visits, they finally scratched a
message  on the door: ''no se presta herramienta'' -- we don't lend
tools.
 ''steve  was a little anti-social,'' the bespectacled neira
recalled  in an interview. ''i mean, he was polite and spoke spanish
well,  but he let you know he didn't want to strike up a
friendship.''
 nor  did he make any attempt to explain the sound of hammering
and  the hiss of welding torches that emanated from the red-brick
warehouse.
 for  good measure they kept a rottweiler on the premises.
passers-by  sometimes heard the workers call his name, lucas.
every  weekday, 13-year-old john alvarez and his buddies would
walk  past the warehouse on their way to school and wonder about the
hammering  and the shadowy men coming and going. a car repair shop?
if  so, where were the broken-down cars? all the boys saw were
expensive  new suvs and sedans being driven by the warehouse
workers.
 on  june 16, the last school day before vacation, john was
walking  home in his scuffed buster brown shoes, blue v-neck sweater
and  gray slacks. he lingered by the warehouse. it was now or never.
he  dared himself to creep up to the door.
as  he got close, the rottweiler came bounding out of nowhere and
chased  john away.
according  to pablo neira and employees of a nearby texaco
station,  the work sometimes went on around the clock. other times,
the  warehouse was silent for days.
the  workers brought in their own food and booze in bulk, had
their  own cook and installed four security cameras on the roof.
investigators  say russians, including perhaps the sub's designer,
were  among those working at the warehouse.
among  papers police found was a list of handwritten words in
russian  and their spanish equivalents: cigarettes, capsules,
russian,  oil.
the  russian angle was not entirely a surprise to the
investigators.  russian mobsters are increasing their operations in
colombia,  especially in drug- and gunrunning. several years ago,
colombian  drug lords even tried to obtain a russian military
submarine  from corrupt russian officials, using a go-between in the
united  states.
the  workers in the warehouse recorded their expenses
meticulously  on notebook paper, from liquor, wine and cookies to
$1.30  for 50 screws, complete with the hardware store receipt.
pinup  calendar girls and greasy tools were found scattered on
work  benches, along with welding equipment from russia and the
united  states, and a system of pipes and valves from britain. a
tool  catalogue from a chicago-area company lay on a table.
looming  over everything was the bullet-nosed sub, 100 feet long
--  nearly the length of three new york city buses. it looked like a
reddish  metallic whale sliced into three segments. metal benches,
perhaps  for bunk beds, ran the length of one section.
the  submarine had rudders, but no propeller had yet been
installed.  investigators think it was within months of being
completed.  authorities believe a computerized navigation system was
being  assembled elsewhere.
------
 navy  capt. fidel azula is colombia's longest-serving submarine
skipper.  pictures of colombia's german- and italian-built
submarines  decorate his office in the defense ministry in bogota.
azula  loves submarines, and doesn't disguise his admiration for
the  men who were building the perfect smuggling device and managing
to  keep the whole project secret.
''even  our military doesn't have the capacity to build a
submarine,''  said the 20-year submarine veteran.
it  probably would have taken a crew of five to run the sub,
azula  said. he believes it would have been capable of traveling
deep  enough to elude u.s. coast guard cutters and other security
measures.
 ''submarines  are almost impossible to detect unless you have
intelligence  that they will be in a particular place,'' he said.
the  smugglers could have released their load of drugs from a
hatch  without ever surfacing. the load would have popped up on the
surface  for pickup by a boat.
the  sub's design is innovative, azula said. instead of ballast
tanks  in the front and rear, this one had a double-walled hull.
water  would have flooded the outer hull through a series of
holes,  causing the submarine to dive. pressurized air could have
drained  the hull to make it rise.
azula  is still trying to figure out exactly how the system
worked,  and would love to have a chat with the designer, who
obviously  knew what he was doing.
''it's  not easy to make a resistant hull, and to make the
flanges  on the parts of the sub form a perfect seal,'' azula said.
''it  requires very special skill and equipment.''
the  united states congress, unhappy about delays in delivering
u.s.  anti-drug aid to colombia, is noting the submarine project
with  frustration.
''the  russian-speaking mafia, in conjunction with the drug
traffickers,  got the steel, the tools and manuals down to colombia
and  built a pressurized, double-hulled submarine,'' rep. benjamin
gilman,  r-n.y., said at a sept. 21 hearing on capitol hill.
''our  state department ought to be able to deliver our
counter-drug  aid at least that well,'' gilman added. ''if not, i
think  we're in major troubles.''
the  sub builders bought much of their equipment from hardware
stores  in downtown bogota, according to copies of the seized
receipts  obtained by the associated press.
employees  of the shops don't recall who bought the items, but
hero-worship  them all the same.
''imagine,  that they did this. it is ingenious,'' exclaimed
esperanza  lara, who runs the campana shop that sold welding
materials  to the sub builders.
azula  is sure that with so much drug money in play, someone,
somewhere,  will try again.
but  is this the first? could there be another submarine, not yet
discovered,  running silent and deep with loads of colombian
cocaine?
 ''we  don't know, but i hope there isn't. i hope this was the
first  one,'' said leo arreguin, chief of u.s. drug enforcement
administration's  operation in colombia.
''it's  scary, the amount of drugs that could have reached the
united  states if this project had been successful,'' he said.
speaking  in his office in the fortress-like u.s. embassy in the
capital,  arreguin said he believes several colombian drug cartels
pooled  their money to finance the submarine's construction, and
were  advised by steve smit -- if that is his real name -- and russian
submarine  experts.
dea  agents are now poring over telephone and immigration records
in  their search for smit and the other sub builders. agents in the
united  states have already questioned a person in atlanta. the lead
turned  out to be an apparent dead end.
police  detained an american reporter visiting the warehouse and
carefully  checked his id. ''steve looked a lot like you,'' pablo
neira  later told the reporter.
the  dea suspects smit is american but won't release details on
the  probe. ''we do not comment on ongoing investigations,'' said a
spokesman  at dea headquarters in northern virginia.
the  russian embassy is also investigating, but did not respond
to  repeated interview requests.
the  submarine is still in the warehouse, and there have been no
arrests.  ''the dog is the only witness we have,'' said uribe, the
police  lieutenant who discovered the sub.
pablo  neira, meanwhile, feels a shadow has been cast over his
family,  even though police have ruled them out as suspects.
he  is thinking about cashing in on the warehouse's notoriety by
opening  a restaurant there after investigators have hauled away the
sub.
 what  will he serve?
''probably  seafood,'' he said. ''or submarine sandwiches.''

[HEADLINE] :  12 palestinians killed in clashes
[TEXT]
jerusalem  (ap) -- israeli troops battling several gunmen and
thousands  of rock-throwing palestinians opened fire saturday,
killing  12 palestinians in the bloodiest clashes in the west bank
and  gaza strip since 1996. more than 500 palestinians were injured,
the  palestinian health minister said.
among  those killed was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the
cross  fire. cowering behind his father, he screamed in panic as
shots  hit a wall just inches above their heads. seconds later, the
boy  was fatally shot in the abdomen.
the  trigger for the violence was a visit by israel's hard-line
opposition  leader, ariel sharon, last week to a bitterly contested
jerusalem  shrine sacred to muslims and jews. sharon said he toured
the  compound to show israel was in control there.
on  friday, six palestinians were killed and close to 200 wounded
in  clashes in the walled compound.
''the  battle over jerusalem has begun,'' said bassem naim, a
palestinian  activist, as thousands of protesters chanting the
muslim  battle cry ''allahu akbar,'' or god is great, marched toward
an  israeli army position.
further  dimming prospects for an israeli-palestinian peace
treaty,  the two sides traded angry accusations saturday.
israeli  prime minister ehud barak spoke to palestinian leader
yasser  arafat by phone late saturday. ''the prime minister warned
arafat  that he (barak) will not let violence a tool in the
negotiations,''  barak's office said in a statement.
israel's  army chief, lt. gen. shaul mofaz, said the palestinian
authority  did nothing to stop the violence, and that palestinian
police  officers in some cases even participated in the clashes.
palestinian  peace negotiator nabil shaath called the deadly
confrontations  at the jerusalem shrine a ''premeditated massacre''
by  israeli security forces, aimed at proving that israel is
sovereign  there.
from  the town of jenin in the northern edge of the west bank to
jerusalem's  mount of olives and the dusty refugee camp of khan
yunis  at the end of the gaza strip, similar scenes were replayed
over  and over saturday.
palestinian  youths hurled rocks, some twirling slingshots for a
longer  aim. others stuffed gasoline-soaked rags into bottles and
threw  them at israeli soldiers who fired rubber-coated steel
pellets  and live rounds from behind walls and jeeps.
streets  were littered with rocks, garbage bins were overturned
and  plumes of black smoke from burning tires rose into the sky. in
hebron,  rioters running out of rocks had them ferried to the scene
in  taxis.
the  palestinian authority, providing a list of names and ages,
said  12 palestinians were killed and four were brain dead as a
result  of army fire. the palestinian health minister, riad zanoun,
said  523 palestinians were injured. the israeli army said 11
soldiers  were injured.
in  two spots -- an army outpost outside the jewish settlement of
netzarim  in gaza and south of the west bank town of nablus --
several  palestinians, some masked, exchanged fire with israeli
soldiers.
 ''the  israelis must understand that palestinians can also shoot
and  kill,'' said a 25-year-old gunman armed with an m-16 assault
rifle  who would not give his name.
in  netzarim, 12-year-old mohammed aldura and his father, jamal,
were  caught in the cross fire. the boy screamed in panic as bullets
hit  a wall just inches above their heads. at one point, the father
raised  his head above the metal barrel that served as their cover
and  shook his finger, as if to admonish those firing at him.
moments  later, mohammed slumped to the ground, fatally hit, and the
father,  gravely wounded, lost consciousness.
besides  mohammed, two other palestinians died in the clash,
including  an ambulance driver who tried to rescue him and a
palestinian  policeman. israeli troops fired anti-tank missiles
during  the firefight, the army said.
the  deadliest confrontation erupted in nablus, where six
palestinians,  including two policemen and a 16-year-old boy, were
killed  in a protracted firefight. gunmen, their faces covered by
checkered  headscarves and black ski masks, shot from olive grove at
israeli  soldiers crouching behind jeeps.
the  16-year-old victim was khaled bazyan, who had dropped out of
high  school three days ago and taken a job at a car wash near the
site  of the clashes. ''when the israeli army withdrew from nablus,
we  felt safe,'' said bazyan's father, adli. ''but today, we felt
that  the occupation is still here, on our land.''
three  more palestinians were killed in the west bank town of
ramallah.
 palestinians  say the trigger for the violence was sharon's visit
thursday  to the disputed jerusalem hilltop known to jews as the
temple  mount and to muslims as haram as-sharif, or noble sanctuary.
sharon  dismissed the charges. ''it wasn't my visit that incited
the  fire. it was the palestinian authority incitement that has been
going  on for some time,'' sharon told israel tv's channel two.
israeli-palestinian  peace talks are hung up because of rival
sovereignty  claims to the shrine, which was once home to the
biblical  jewish temple, judaism's holiest site, and now houses two
major  mosques that mark the spot where tradition says the prophet
muhammad  ascended to heaven. the walled compound is the third
holiest  site of islam. neither side wants the other to have full
control.  all u.s. compromise proposals have been rejected so far by
the  negotiators.
secretary  of state madeleine albright, in iceland on saturday
during  a trip to europe, said she had spoken to both parties to try
to  ease tensions.
''we  are very concerned about the violence. it is clearly
counterproductive  in the peace process,'' albright said.
the  violence on friday and saturday was the deadliest since
september  1996, when 59 palestinians, 16 israelis and three
egyptians  were killed in three days of gun battles between
palestinian  police and israeli troops.
the  latest clashes came as israelis marked the first day of
their  two-day new year's holiday, a time of festive family meals
and  outings.
many  israelis felt the palestinians were responsible. ''despite
the  fact that there is a peace process, they (the palestinians)
want  to ruin everything,'' said meirav buchbut, 21, a bookkeeper
from  the town of netanya. ''there won't be peace. there will only
be  war.''

washington  (ap) -- george w. bush offered a three-minute videotaped address
to  the christian coalition today to soothe any hard feelings created by his
decision  not to attend their convention in person and he reaffirmed his support
for  their values. ''should i be elected, i will lead our nation toward a culture
that  values life, the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of the young
and  the life of the unborn,'' bush said. he did not explain why he initially

fbi  expands probe of debate tape
washington  (ap) -- the fbi has expanded its investigation to determine if
superiors  of an employee of a bush media consultant were involved in sending a
bush  debate tape to his democratic opponent, a federal law enforcement official
said  today. the bureau has opened a full criminal investigation of debate
preparation  materials for george w. bush that were mailed to a confidante of al
gore,  the official said. ''i'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy
would  have mailed the tape,'' bush said today from his ranch in crawford, texas,
where  he was preparing for the first debate with aides. ''i look forward to
finding  out who it is.''
white  house appeals for jerusalem calm
washington  (ap) -- the clinton administration appealed for calm today in
violence-wracked  jerusalem, saying that the highly charged issue of the city's
future  must be solved ''at the negotiating table and not in the streets.'' a
dozen  palestinians were reported killed and 523 wounded as israeli police
battled  several gunmen and thousands of rockthrowers. ''we are very concerned
about  the violence,'' secretary of state madeleine albright said in iceland, one
stop  in her european trip. she said that she had telephoned both yasser arafat,
the  palestinian leader, and israeli prime minister ehud barak in an effort to
ease  tensions.
russia  offers yugoslavia mediation
belgrade,  yugoslavia (ap) -- russia offered today to try and mediate the
showdown  between slobodan milosevic and opposition forces, but secretary of
state  madeleine albright said the russians should accept his sept. 24 election
defeat  and send a message that milosevic is ''finished.'' there was no official
reaction  to the russian offer. but at a speech today, milosevic said: ''we alone
will  decide our fate.'' thousands of opposition supporters gathered in belgrade
this  evening to hear their leaders announce a general strike for monday and a
limited  road blockade tomorrow as a ''dress rehearsal.''

[HEADLINE] :  foreigners fear ivory coast tension
[TEXT]
abidjan,  ivory coast (ap) -- stability made ivory coast what it
was  for 40 years -- a beachhead for westerners in troubled west
africa,  complete with skyscrapered skyline, well-made croissants
and  the only ice skating between egypt and south africa.
peace  and prosperity drew millions, from african migrant workers
to  lebanese restaurateurs, american missionaries to french
financiers.  expatriates joked they settled in bustling abidjan
because  ''it's so convenient to africa.''
but  yesterday's welcome is turning ever more to today's threat
for  the outsiders who now make up as much as one-third of ivory
coast's  population.
the  military junta that took power amid the country's first-ever
coup,  on christmas eve, increasingly is appealing to anti-foreigner
sentiment  in its bid to stay in power through an election promised
for  oct. 22 to return ivory coast to civilian control.
after  shooting, looting and now near-daily scares of more to
come,  life for ivory coast's expatriates has become a worry of if,
when  -- and how -- to get out.
''we  have extra provisions packed and can leave quickly, but one
thing  we don't know -- where's the rendezvous point?'' marysha
yonis,  a british-american, said as she picked up some of her three
children  at an english-language school in ivory coast's commercial
center  of abidjan.
''we  know the embassy will take care of us, but will it be an
airport  evacuation -- because last time they closed the airport -- or
by  water?'' yonis wondered, while saying the time to run had not
yet  come -- and might not ever.
most  of ivory coast's foreign population are laborers from
neighboring  african countries -- and many of them have already sent
their  families home.
the  same holds for true for the non-african population, which
numbered  up to 330,000, most lebanese, before the recent troubles.
enrollment  at the english-language school dropped 10 percent over
summer  break.
the  drop is greater at the city's french-language expatriate
school,  said merchant john salame, a french national who sent his
wife  and three children to france over summer vacation
''every  week, we hear something, so we tell them, 'stay away,''
said  salame, whose warehouse was one of several looted in the
december  coup. ''when it gets worse, all of us will be leaving.''
salame  and many others here are veterans of west africa's other
unrest  -- arriving in ivory coast after violent upheaval in togo,
sierra  leone, liberia or elsewhere.
ivory  coast was supposed to be a haven from all that.
under  founder felix houphouet-boigny, ivory coast grew to be the
most  prosperous country in tropical africa after independence in
1960.  his conservatism, patronage by the former french colonial
rulers  and development of cocoa, coffee and palm oil crops made
ivory  coast flourish. even in the late 1990s, after
houphouet-boigny's  death in 1993, the annual growth rate hit 5 to 6
percent.
 a  drop in cocoa prices helped change all that -- the one-time ice
skating  rink is now a dank slab in the now-mildewing, once-snazzy
hotel  ivoire.
on  christmas eve, gunfire in the streets punctuated the end of
an  era in ivory coast.
guei  assumed power within days of the coup, promising that
military  rule would be finite and bloodless.
soon,  however, the general traded his uniform for statesmanlike
gray  and blue suits -- and today is showing increasing unwillingness
to  surrender power.
abidjan  awoke sept. 18 to yet more machine-fire fire -- an
assassination  attempt against guei, backed by allies of main
opposition  leader alassane dramane ouattara, the junta claimed.
arrests  followed, as did opposition claims of torture and
killings  -- accusations the government has denied.
the  wait for a potentially explosive announcement on whether
ouattara  will be allowed to run against guei in the scheduled oct.
22  presidential vote keeps tensions running strong.
guei's  junta claims ouattara is secretly a foreigner and thus
ineligible.  guei, who rejected african leaders' attempt at
mediation  last week as unwanted outside interference, increasingly
depicts  ivory coast's troubles as us vs. the world.
''foreigners  out!'' ivorians screamed in one angry pro-junta
demonstration  last week, while guei looked on smiling.
''the  country is almost suffering in comparison with nigeria,
which  shows how far it's fallen,'' gregory kronsten, a london-based
financial  analyst with westlb, said by telephone.
the  situation is bad enough that the african development bank,
ivory  coast's leading foreign presence with 1,100 jobs, has drawn
up  emergency plans for moving to another country, staffers say.
bank  officials refused on-the-record comment.
the  size of the non-african expatriate community here could make
any  evacuation unparalleled in the recent history of african
troubles.
 many  expatriates have stockpiled food and water, drawn up phone
trees  to spread news in case of trouble, and dropped by their
embassies  to leave hand-drawn maps of the routes to their homes --
essential  in a city where few streets have names.
''i've  packed my bag of coup food,'' said american mother
stephanie  schulte, who put the same precaution to use in unrest in
togo.  ''i'm hoping i don't have to use it.''
france,  with 20,000 to 30,000 nationals here, has a military
ship  stationed somewhere offshore able to evacuate 3,000 people.
the  u.s. embassy and other western embassies have contingency plans
as  a matter of routine.
missionaries  make up the biggest single bloc of ivory coast's
2,000-2,500  americans. the missionaries plan to meet tuesday to try
to  draw up plans of their own.
''people  are seeking to do what they can to prepare for what
could  be a bad situation,'' said paul shaddick, assistant director
of  ivory coast's international linguistic society, whose work
includes  translating religious works.
''there  are a lot of foreigners in the country,'' shaddick said.
''ivory  coast has always had a place for them. until now.''

[HEADLINE] :  drug policy agency witholds payment
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- the white house drug policy office is
withholding  more than $13 million in payments to a major
advertising  firm while it determines whether the company overbilled
the  government.
officials  of the office of national drug policy said saturday
examination  of invoices submitted by the advertising firm of ogilvy
&amp;  mather are standard, routine operating procedures.
about  $13.5 million of $187 million billed by ogilvy &amp; mather
have  been withheld pending negotiations, the officials said. the
money  was spent on an ad campaign urging young people to stay away
from  drugs.
an  outside consultant employed to assess the charges found the
billed  costs, particularly for labor, were ''dramatically higher
than  even the high end of what is standard industry practice.''
nonetheless,  drug policy officials said withholding the payments
is  nothing more than routine procedure.
''it  is standard operating practice for us to scrutinize
everything,''  said pancho kinney, the drug office's director for
strategic  operations. ''there is absolutely nothing here that
concerns  us. what we are doing is pursuing prudent measures to
protect  the public interest. the great majority of questioned costs
has  been found allowable.''
bob  weiner, the agency's spokesman, questioned what he said is
renewed  political interest in the issue by congressional
republicans,  who he said have scheduled a hearing for next week.
''we  are wondering if there is a political motive in that this
is  taking place 30 days before the presidential election,'' weiner
said.
 howard  paster, an ogilvy spokesman, told the new york times,
which  reported the story saturday, that it is commonplace for bills
to  be negotiated. the company expects to be paid for its work with
no  significant reduction in billing, paster said.
the  general accounting office began an inquiry into the ogilvy
contract  in july.
ogilvy  is the primary contractor in an anti-drug advertising and
education  effort called the national youth anti-drug media
campaign.  the campaign, which began in 1998, is expected to cost
nearly  $1 billion over five years.
the  campaign caused a stir this year when it was revealed that
popular  television shows were submitting scripts to the white house
drug  office. in return, tv networks received millions of dollars
worth  of financial credits for including positive anti-drug
messages  in their shows.

[HEADLINE] :  independence party loses support of leaders in rochester
[TEXT]
	  rochester, n.y. (ap) - mega-millionaire b. thomas golisano won
enough  votes in two quixotic bids for governor to give the
fledgling  new york independence party an automatic spot on the
ballot  through 2002.
now  fellow party founders and leaders from the rochester area
are  quitting. they complain the leadership has been usurped by a
faction  led by left-wing activist lenora fulani and no longer
represents  ''radical middle'' voters who feel alienated by the two
major  parties.
bill  neild, a party founder, said he is resigning along with
state  party secretary laureen oliver and monroe county chairman
david  stockmeister.
''i  look at it like a marriage that went bad,'' oliver said in
saturday's  rochester democrat and chronicle. ''it's time for a
divorce.''
 golisano  declined to comment on the defections.
the  party was created ahead of the 1994 gubernatorial election
in  which golisano came in third but drew more than the 50,000 votes
needed  to win a place on the ballot for four years. he repeated his
third-place  finish in 1998.
in  june, the suburban rochester businessman said the odds were
against  him making a third run. but while the party has been riven
by  leadership battles for much of this year, golisano also said at
the  time that he felt it remained strong and would likely survive.
fulani,  however, told the newspaper that the party's success
doesn't  hinge on golisano continuing to run for governor. she
pointed  to the party's 172,000 members as its source of strength.
the  leadership team elected earlier this month at an annual
convention  is moving the independence party away from the middle,
she  said. ''we're not a centrist party, we're a populist party,''
she  said.

[HEADLINE] :  state opens probe into choking death of bridgewater 2-year-old
[TEXT]
	  bridgewater, n.j. (ap) - the state health department is
investigating  how police and emergency service workers responded to
a  call for help from the mother of a 2-year-old who was choking on
a  toy.
the  girl, nicole iarrapino, died aug. 31, a day after her mother
frantically  called 911. the somerset county prosecutor's office is
investigating  allegations that an emergency medical technician who
was  nearby was told not to respond to the child's house.
''we  are investigating this incident because there was a death
and  there are questions about this death, and we are concerned
about  the quality of care,'' said marilyn riley, a spokeswoman for
the  department of health and senior services. ''i mean, a child
died.''
 somerset  county prosecutor wayne forrest is investigating an
anonymous  letter sent to the iarrapino family claiming an emergency
medical  technician in the area was told not to respond to the
scene.
 the  letter claimed the emt, robert hanlon, had lifesaving
equipment  in his car and would have arrived much earlier than
rescue  squad personnel. the letter claims hanlon, a police
department  employee with 18 years as an emergency medical
technician,  was in the area but was called off by headquarters.
''we  interviewed hanlon and he said he never began to respond,''
forrest  said.
but  friday, hanlon said his ''intention was to respond,'' and he
felt  that he was ''called off'' by headquarters.

[HEADLINE] :  imf, world bank to face congress
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- after weathering violent protests in the
streets  of prague, leaders of the two major international lending
institutions  must face congress, where key republicans are ready to
cut  deeply into their programs unless they change how they do
business.
 at  stake is a $435 million clinton administration request in
behalf  of the world bank and the international monetary fund for a
high-profile  initiative to provide debt relief for the world's
poorest  nations.
worried  that the money could fall victim to a last-minute
congressional  rush to adjourn, president clinton planned a strategy
session  monday with members of congress and religious leaders who
have  called debt relief a moral imperative.
in  one way, the gop lawmakers and the demonstrators in the czech
republic  share a common belief -- that the world bank and the imf
have  done more harm than good in trying to alleviate poverty around
the  world.
''i  am supportive of debt forgiveness for desperately poor
countries  that have no hope of repaying their loans, but the
benefits  have to go to the people who live in those countries and
not  to the corrupt elite who run them,'' sen. phil gramm, r-texas,
said  last week. he and sen. jesse helms, r-n.c., are pushing a
16-point  reform agenda for both institutions.
on  the house side, conservative republicans, led by house
majority  leader richard armey of texas, and rep. jim saxton of new
jersey,  are making similar demands in what is shaping up as one of
the  big session-ending budget battles.
gop  critics are armed with a highly critical report done by an
advisory  commission chaired by allan meltzer, an economics
professor  at carnegie mellon university in pittsburgh.
meltzer's  group charged that the imf and the world bank badly
botched  the 1997-98 asian currency crisis, which plunged 40 percent
of  the world economy into recession, and have failed to alleviate
poverty.
 the  administration says the meltzer commission's
recommendations,  which form the basis for many of the gramm-helms
demands,  are too draconian.
in  the effort to get the necessary votes, the administration
plans  to cite results of recent meetings in the czech republic,
where  the imf and world bank committed themselves to many items on
a  reform agenda championed by the united states.
the  united states succeeded in winning overhaul of the imf's
lending  programs to discourage overuse of imf loans.
the  imf also has committed to moving ahead with tougher auditing
requirements  and less secrecy surrounding the economic advice it
gives  countries.
the  world bank, once known primarily for its loans for
controversial  dam projects, has pledged to diversify its lending
and  to concentrate on projects with the greatest promise of
reducing  poverty and disease.
''the  imf is moving in the right direction. i think they are
accepting  a lot of the recommendations we have made,'' meltzer said
in  an interview. ''we see a lot of progress at the imf and very
little  progress at the world bank.''
morris  goldstein, a former imf official and now an economist at
the  institute for international economics, gave credit to new imf
managing  director horst koehler, a former german finance ministry
official.
 ''koehler  is saying the right things. he wants a leaner imf that
is  more focused,'' goldstein said. ''but he is going to face a lot
of  conflicting pressures.''
even  poverty and watchdog groups long critical of the imf and
world  bank believe the reform efforts at both institutions are
having  some impact.
they  were able to successfully lobby koehler to drop imf demands
that  mozambique remove protective tariffs around its sugar industry
at  a time of low world prices.
koehler  ''agreed with our logic. he told me he isn't always
going  to agree with us, but he let us make our case,'' said seth
amgott,  a representative of oxfam, the international poverty
agency.

[TEXT]
new  york (ap) -- jorge toca hit a three-run double in the eighth
inning  to lead the new york mets to a 4-2 victory over the montreal
expos  on saturday.
toca,  a late-season callup, hit a drive off javier vazquez into
the  gap in left-center field to lead the mets to their fourth
straight  victory.
montreal  lost its season-high eighth in a row.
center  fielder jay payton was the only mets starter to play all
nine  innings. manager bobby valentine emptied his bench, using 17
of  19 available position players, as the nl wild card winner
prepares  for the playoffs.
vazquez  (11-9) cruised through the first seven innings, allowing
just  one run on five hits. but bubba trammell walked to lead off
the  mets eighth and pinch-hitter lenny harris singled.
joe  mcewing sacrificed, and todd pratt was intentionally walked
to  load the bases to set up toca's hit.
turk  wendell (8-6) pitched a scoreless eighth to pick up the
victory.  armando benitez pitched the ninth for his 41st save in 46
opportunities.
 jose  vidro gave the expos a 1-0 lead in the second inning with a
home  run into the picnic area in left-center field off glendon
rusch.  vidro's 24th homer was his 200th hit of the season.
montreal  took a 2-0 lead on michael barrett's rbi single in the
fifth.  mike mordecai hit a leadoff double down the left-field line
and  barrett followed with a single.
the  mets got a run back in the fifth when payton doubled and
pinch-hitter  matt franco singled to right. vladimir guerrero
bare-handed  the ball and threw home, but payton beat the throw to
make  it 2-1.
rusch,  looking to earn a spot in the postseason starting
rotation,  allowed two runs, four hits, struck out two and walked
one  in five innings.
vazquez  allowed four runs, seven hits, and walked four in 7 1-3
innings.
 notes:  al leiter, the mets' possible game 1 starter wednesday
against  either san francisco or st. louis, will skip his scheduled
start  sunday. rick reed will start instead. ... valentine and gm
steve  phillips remained non-committal on announcing the game 1
starter,  as well as the team's rotation and 25-man roster. ... mets
of  timoniel perez hit a leadoff single in the first, but left after
experiencing  tightness in his right hamstring while running to
third  on derek bell's groundout. perez is day-to-day. ... the only
mets  position players who didn't play were of benny agbayani, who
is  nursing a sore hamstring, and c vance wilson. ... of brian cole
was  selected the mets' organizational player of the year, and rhp
pat  strange the pitcher of the year.

[HEADLINE] :  contractor fined after workers' fall
[TEXT]
	  parsippany, n.j. (ap) - a new jersey contractor faces $112,000
in  federal fines six months after a roof collapse caused two
workers  to fall 30 feet to the ground.
both  james kenney, 30, of wayne, and ronald markiewicz, 19, of
mount  arlington, suffered fractured bones in the fall, which
happened  as they were helping build a warehouse in fairfield.
the  federal occupational safety and health administration found
that  the contractor, lunar steel, failed to secure the framework at
the  site and did not provide employees with safety equipment such
as  harnesses or a safety net.
''the  willful nature of the violations is unmistakable,'' david
ippolito,  an area director for osha, said in a prepared statement
last  week. ''this employer exhibited a significant disregard for
the  health and safety of its employees.''
when  asked if the company would appeal, a spokeswoman for the
contractor  said lunar executives hoped to reach a settlement with
regulators  next month.
osha's  parsippany office conducted the investigation.

[HEADLINE] :  1 arrested, others sought in atm scam
[TEXT]
newark,  n.j. (ap) - police in northern new jersey are looking
for  several men they say are tricking automated teller machine
customers  into giving up their personal identification numbers,
then  stealing cash from their accounts.
one  suspect was arrested friday, and several others are still
being  sought in connection with thefts in parsippany, pequannock,
wayne  and west caldwell.
the  suspects typically place a sticky substance such as tape or
glue  into the card slot of an atm machine, then tape a cardboard
sign  next to the machine advising, 'if for technical reasons your
card  is retained in the atm, re-enter pin and hit cancel.''
the  sticky substance prevents the patron from removing the card
from  the machine, and the suspects stand close enough to the
machine  to watch the patron re-enter the pin number and record it.
when  the patron leaves the machine with their card still inside,
the  suspects approach the machine, enter the customer's pin, and
withdraw  cash from their accounts.
parsippany  lt. james storms said more than $500 was stolen from
first  union bank accounts in three instances in his community. when
incidents  from the other three towns are included, the suspects are
believed  to have stolen several thousand dollars from various
banks'  accounts.
after  setting up surveillance at local banks and receiving an
anonymous  tip about the identity of one of the suspects, parsippany
police  arrested janet castano, 36, of victory gardens, and charged
her  with false impersonation; forgery; theft by deception;
possession  of burglary tools; conspiracy to commit theft; and theft
of  moveable property. she was released on $10,000 bail.
parsippany  police have also issued an arrest warrant charging
victor  cardonna, 27, of victory gardens, with the same charges. he
remained  at large on saturday.
police  also say several other unidentified suspects are being
sought.

[HEADLINE] :  census count may cause problems for new jersey
[TEXT]
	  trenton, n.j. (ap) - the u.s. census bureau's efforts to make
the  2000 count more accurate may cause problems for new jersey,
including  a possible delay in next year's primary election and
redistricting  complications.
the  census bureau is taking raw numbers and statistically
adjusting  them so it doesn't undercount like it did 10 years ago.
but  that may mean detailed census figures won't be delivered to
the  state until march, leaving just a month for a state commission
to  redraw legislative districts. that task must be completed by
april  12, the filing deadline for republicans and democrats to
declare  themselves candidates for the june 5 primary.
''there's  no way we can do that,'' senate minority leader
richard  codey told the star-ledger of newark in saturday's
editions.
 states  redraw legislative and congressional districts to reflect
shifting  population every 10 years after a census. that process may
be  rushed in new jersey because the state holds legislative
elections  in 2001. the governor's job and all 120 legislative seats
are  up for next year's election.
that  in turn, legislative leaders say, may prompt lawmakers to
push  back next year's primary by a few weeks or possibly a few
months  - or even hold two primaries for governor and the state
legislature.
 ''we're  getting very frightening signals about when they can get
(the  numbers),'' said peter mcdonough, a spokesman for gov.
christie  whitman. ''it could really foul up our process if we don't
get  accurate numbers quickly.''
a  commission of five democrats and five republicans redraws
districts  once census numbers are in. the process can be
contentious  because redistricting can determine a party's majority
for  a decade of elections. the commission has 30 days to drew up
new  districts.
a  deadlock could prompt state supreme court chief justice
deborah  poritz to appoint an 11th, independent member to spend
another  30 days to complete a redistricting map.
in  that scenario, redistricting would not be complete until may,
which  is too late for candidates to file. in 1991, the commission
finished  its work at the end of march after receiving census
numbers  in january.
state  officials said they are pressuring the census bureau to
release  new jersey's numbers in march. state population totals are
released  in dec. 31, but the bureau does not have to release
detailed  data until april 1.

minneapolis  (ap) -- tellis redmon ran for 183 yards on 31 carries
and  caught three passes for 116 yards as minnesota beat no. 24
illinois  44-10 on saturday.
redmon  rushed for 151 yards in the first half. travis cole added
82  yards on 13 carries and completed 8 of 13 passes for 170 yards
over  three quarters.
minnesota  stifled the illini offense, which was limited to a
35-yard  field goal by steve fitts in the second quarter and a
21-yard  touchdown pass from backup quarterback dustin ward to eric
mcgoey  with 35 seconds remaining. minnesota scored the game's first
28  points and led 28-3 at halftime.
the  outcome easily was the best performance of the season for
the  gophers (3-2, 1-1 big ten), who were coming off a 38-24 loss at
purdue,  and the worst by the fighting illini (3-2, 0-2), who lost
35-31  to michigan last week.
on  a second-quarter possession, the gophers continually ran
redmon  inside and dared the illini to stop him. redmon carried the
ball  on all six downs of a drive that began at the 50 and ended
with  his 3-yard touchdown. redmon also had a 25-yard touchdown run
later  in the second quarter. he set up a 19-yard field goal by dan
nystrom  in the third quarter by running 62 yards along the right
sideline  after catching a short pass from cole.
as  the game wore on, the quarterback controversy at minnesota
shifted  to running back. redmon, who broke the 100-yard rushing
barrier  midway through the second quarter, returned to the starting
job  he had lost when redshirt thomas tapeh gained 183 yards against
baylor  because of tapeh's foot injury.
cole,  a junior-college transfer, took over the starting job from
redshirt  freshman asad abdul-khaliq after passing for 180 yards in
mop-up  duty against purdue last week. abdul-khaliq entered the game
in  the fourth quarter, with the gophers leading 34-3.
cole  scored the gophers' two first-quarter touchdowns, sweeping
left  for 28 yards and following his center on a 1-yard burst. he
scrambled  for a 21-yard gain on the second touchdown drive.
illinois'  kurt kittner, hurried most of the afternoon, completed
only  13 of 34 passes for 103 yards. gophers defensive tackle mike
anderle  deflected five of kittner's passes.
in  the fourth quarter, gophers cornerback trevis graham
intercepted  a pass from ward and returned it 71 yards for a
touchdown.
 nystrom  kicked three field goals for the gophers.
the  outcome was similar to minnesota's 37-7 victory over the
illini  last season. the gophers, led by thomas hamner's 184 yards
rushing,  gained 367 yards rushing against the illini one year ago.

statesboro,  ga. (ap) -- junior adrian peterson became the ncaa
division  i-aa career rushing touchdown and yardage leader when he
ran  for 182 yards and four touchdowns in leading georgia southern
to  a 56-3 rout of virginia military on saturday.
peterson's  182 yards on 25 carries lifted his career total to
6,092  yards, breaking the mark of 5,931 yards set by chris parker
of  marshall from 1991-95.
the  four rushing touchdowns came on runs of 1, 29, 8 and 8
yards,  lifting his career total to 63 in bettering the previous
mark  of 60 set by new hampshire's jerry azumah from 1995-98.
peterson  had a fifth score in the game, grabbing a 20-yard
touchdown  pass from j.r. revere. with southern building a 42-0
halftime  lead, peterson played a little less than three quarters.
southern  (4-1, 3-0 southern conference) amassed 577 yards of
offense,  463 on the ground, while vmi (0-5, 0-3) was held to 183
yards.  the keydets' only score came on the final play of the game
when  matt maxey kicked a school-record 57-yard field goal that hit
the  crossbar and bounced over.
revere  added 84 yards on 10 carries and completed 5 of 6 passes
for  114 yards and two scores. revere's other td pass went 31 yards
to  chris johnson.
lavar  rainey scored on a 47-yard interception return in the
second  quarter and the other eagle score came on a 1-yard run by
melvin  cox in the first minute of the final quarter.

[HEADLINE] :  candidates prepare for first debate
[TEXT]
austin,  texas (ap) -- al gore and george w. bush dug into intense
preparations  saturday for the first presidential debate, honing
styles  and strategies for trumping the other guy in confrontations
five  weeks before the election.
for  democrat gore, the road to boston on tuesday led through
sarasota,  fla. republican bush's path led through his ranch in
crawford,  texas.
for  both men, the event is an opportunity to introduce
themselves  to americans only now tuning in what could be the
closest  election since 1960.
issues  ranging from abortion, oil prices, health care, social
security  and education to voting records and reputations provide
fodder  for attacks on such matters as gore's penchant for
exaggeration  and bush's ability to lead.
bush  practiced for the debate at his ranch in crawford, assisted
by  several aides and new hampshire sen. gregg judd, who is playing
the  role of gore.
media  consultant stuart stevens asked bush why his tax cut
proposal  was better than gore's and bush gave back his standard
answer  -- that it would give tax cuts to all americans, not just
targeted  cuts. the mood was lighthearted, during a break when
reporters  came through, with gregg making some jokes at gore's
expense  such as: ''i invented the ranch concept.''
bush  said they practiced friday night and saturday by going
through  ''pepper drills'' where aides pepper him with quick
questions.  and bush said working at the ranch ''helps clear my
mind.''
 ''i  like to come here to this place to get my batteries
recharged,''  he said, adding that he would take a long walk with
his  dog in the afternoon.
before  leaving for florida, gore began a series of consultations
with  americans about what they expect to come out of the debate
series.  the first meetings were with gloria bingle, a steelworker
from  jeannette, pa., and firefighter matt moseley, an atlanta
firefighter  from suburban locust grove, ga.
''we've  been talking about what people look for and listen for
when  watching the debates,'' gore said, as the three sat on a sunny
patio  at the vice president's residence in the naval observatory.
''i  appreciate their help.''
in  recent days, the campaigns have done their best to lower
expectations  for their own candidates.
''we  all know that the vice president is a world-class
debater,''  said bush spokeswoman karen hughes, adding: ''we think
that  the pressure in this debate is really on vice president gore
to  try to change the dynamic of the race. the dynamic of the race
is  that voters want a change.''
after  months of focus-group research, including detailed studies
by  the democratic party and afl-cio, the gore campaign heads into
tuesday's  debate convinced that it has the issues on its side.
''the  number one thing we feel confident about is, when the two
men  stand side by side, al gore comes out ahead because swing
voters  agree overwhelmingly with al gore on the issues,'' said
campaign  communications director mark fabiani he cited such issues
as  repaying the national debt, using the budget surplus to shore up
social  security and providing for prescription drugs under
medicare.
 gore's  ratcheted-up rhetoric in recent days offers hints on
where  he is headed tuesday. he hopes to portray bush as inherently
opposed  to medicare and bent on its undoing.
also  look for gore's environmentalism to play a role in the
debates.  fabiani said gore will look for opportunities to
underscore  bush's and cheney's ties to the oil companies -- or, as
gore  likes to call it, big oil.
aides  say gore has not spent much time worrying about how to
inoculate  himself against attacks on his character or veracity
because  his campaign does not believe that bush will risk possible
voter  backlash by raising such issues in debate -- not the first
one,  at least.
bush  believes gore's character is an issue when it comes to
public  policy. he has made the case at recent campaign stops that
voting  for gore would make trust in the white house a problem --
again  -- on two fronts.
on  the one hand, bush has said gore's penchant for exaggerating
means  he cannot be trusted to tell basic truths. the second trust
problem  often outlined by bush is that gore's targeted tax cuts and
social  security reform plans indicate the vice president doesn't
trust  americans to handle their own financial decisions.
the  vice presidential candidates were also preparing for their
oct.  5. debate in kentucky.
cheney  was huddling in jackson, wyo., with advisers this weekend
who've  studied lieberman, viewed videotapes of his appearances on
talk  shows and on the senate floor and scrutinized his record on
the  issues.
lieberman,  who was at home in connecticut for most of the
weekend  celebrating the jewish new year, was headed to richmond,
ky.,  late sunday for three days of intensive ''debate camp.''

[HEADLINE] :  two electricians burned at newark airport
[TEXT]
newark,  n.j. (ap) - two electrical workers were seriously burned
saturday  by an explosion and fire in a fedex building at newark
international  airport as a drill simulating an airplane crash went
on  outside.
jake  paterek, 47, an electrical foreman with 15 years
experience,  and donna fornoff, 42, an electrician's helper, were
working  in a small electrical closet inside the cargo company's
airport  building just before 11 a.m., said steve coleman, a
spokesman  for the port authority of new york and new jersey.
paterek  was working on an electrical control panel when an
unidentified  metal object fell into the panel and made contact with
live  wires, touching off an explosion and fire that set both
workers  ablaze.
''they  tried to put the fire out on each other by rolling on the
ground,  but there was very little room on the floor of this room,''
coleman  said. ''it was about the size of a small coat closet. they
eventually  got outside the room and rolled on the ground and patted
the  fire out on each other.''
paterek,  suffering from shock and first and second-degree burns
over  55 percent of his body, staggered out the door, to an area
where  emergency crews from essex and union counties were staging a
mock  disaster drill.
crews  from the university of medicine and dentistry of new
jersey,  and union hospital saw paterek, and rushed to his aid. the
drill  was suspended while rescue workers assisted the victims.
they  were taken by ambulance to saint barnabas medical center in
livingston,  where paterek was listed in critical condition in the
burn  unit. fornoff was treated for burns to her hands and arms, and
released.  their hometowns were not immediately available.
coleman  said the drill, which simulated the crash of a 727
aircraft,  continued without incident after the contractors were
taken  to the hospital.

east  lansing, mich. (ap) -- danien anderson ran for two long
touchdowns  and 219 yards saturday, helping northwestern beat no. 18
michigan  state 37-17 for the wildcats' second straight victory over
a  ranked team.
northwestern  (4-1, 2-0 big ten) also got three field goals from
tim  long and used its spread offense to keep michigan state (3-1,
0-1)  off balance early. the wildcats then shifted to a ground game
in  the second half to use up time.
northwestern,  which beat then-no. 7 wisconsin 47-44 in overtime
last  week in madison, took a 23-10 halftime lead, thanks to three
field  goals from long and its wide-open offense.
michigan  state was unable to convert several big plays into
scores,  and the spartans had two costly fumbles.
the  game was tied at 10 after the first quarter, with
northwestern's  teddy johnson catching a 39-yard scoring strike from
zak  kustok, and michigan state's t.j. duckett countering with an
11-yard  touchdown run.
long  kicked two field goals in the second quarter, and andersen
raced  32 yards for a touchdown.
northwestern  ran for 201 yards in the half, to only 63 for
michigan  state as both teams used their pass attacks to register
big  gains and pose scoring threats.
anderson  scored again in the third quarter, breaking loose up
the  middle for a 41-yard run.

college  station, texas (ap) -- ja'mar toombs scored two
touchdowns  in the final 6:58 and texas a&amp;m had three interceptions
and  a blocked punt that led to 20 points as the aggies beat texas
tech  33-15 on saturday.
the  red raiders (4-1, 0-1 big 12) came into the game ranked no.
11  nationally in passing but the aggies (3-1, 1-0) defense had
interceptions  by michael jameson, terrence kiel and sammy davis and
a  blocked punt by jay brooks.
a&amp;m  extended its winning streak at kyle field to 22 games since
a  loss to the red raiders in 1996. tech upset a&amp;m 21-19 last season
when  the aggies went into lubbock ranked no. 6 in the nation.
the  crowd of 83,644 was the second largest ever at kyle field.
with  the aggies leading 19-15, toombs scored on a 3-yard run
with  6:58 to play. after davis intercepted a pass by tech's kliff
kingsbury  on the raiders' next series, toombs scored again on a
1-yarder  with 5:42 to play to end tech's comeback hopes.
the  aggies, beaten by the red raiders in four of their last five
games,  took a 16-7 halftime lead with the help big plays by brooks
and  jameson.
joe  weber capped a&amp;m's first drive of the game with a 14-yard
touchdown  run and the aggies also scored on a 32-yard field goal by
terence  kitchens and a 2-yard run by richard whitaker with 4:19
left  in the half.
whitaker's  touchdown came on the first play after brooks blocked
a  punt by chris birkholz. tech's dorian pitts blocked kitchens'
extra-point  attempt after whitaker's score.
kitchen's  field goal came after a&amp;m safety jameson intercepted a
pass  on a fake field goal try and returned it 76 yards to the red
raiders'  8.
strong  safety terrence kiel got another big play for the aggies
secondary  with an interception at the a&amp;m 13 that led to a 40-yard
field  goal by kitchens with 1:18 left in the third quarter.
texas  tech completed four straight third-down plays, the last
one  going 15 yards for a touchdown from kingsbury to tim baker on
the  first play of the second quarter.
with  tech trailing 19-7, kingsbury completed 6 of 8 passes in a
drive  that ended with a 13-yard touchdown pass to baker with 13:41
left  to play. kingsbury completed a 2-point conversion pass to cole
roberts.

[HEADLINE] :  peru hit by another scandal
[TEXT]
lima,  peru (ap) -- the scandal stunned peruvians, sent ripples
through  the international community and may have contributed to
president  alberto fujimori's decision to break from his powerful
spy  chief.
but  it had nothing to do with a videotape apparently showing
intelligence  head vladimiro montesinos bribing an opposition
lawmaker.  this was peru's other scandal: a clandestine pipeline
smuggling  arms to colombian guerrillas.
colombia  has cast doubt on peru's explanation that the smuggling
was  committed by rogue former military officers -- and many here
suspect  peru's military was behind the arms sales.
that  has in turn raised questions about the role of montesinos,
a  behind-the-scenes operator who controlled a vast network of
informers  and had enormous influence inside the armed forces.
after  the bribery scandal erupted, fujimori decided sept. 16 to
dismantle  the feared national intelligence service, or sin, and cut
short  his own presidency. montesinos fled to panama.
but  many think fujimori's fallout with his top aide came not
over  the bribery scandal, but because of the growing allegations
that  montesinos had a hand in the arms sales to the revolutionary
armed  forces of colombia, or farc, the rebel group battling the
government  in peru's andean neighbor.
''there  are poweful doubts'' about the arms sales, retired army
gen.  sinecio jarama said. ''this is being managed by montesinos.''
at  an aug. 21 press conference, fujimori credited montesinos
with  breaking up the ring, presenting his spy chief in a rare
public  appearance.
former  army lt. jose luis aybar and his brother luis frank
aybar,  a military contractor, were arrested in the case. fujimori
said  the two led a ring that parachuted at least 10,000 assault
rifles,  obtained in jordan, into rebel-held colombian territory
between  march and july of 1999.
a  diplomatic firestorm ensued. jordan flatly contradicted the
account,  and colombian president andres pastrana said ''we have
doubts''  about fujimori's explanation.
jordan's  government said the russian-made kalashnikov assault
rifles  were legally sold to peru in 1998. jordan officials said
they  dealt with peruvian generals.
meanwhile,  peruvian media dug up links between the aybar
brothers  and the intelligence network headed by montesinos.
before  his arrest, jose luis aybar sent a videotape to the tv
station  canal n in which he said he had thought he was involved in
a  military intelligence operation when he got involved in the
weapons  deal.
also,  an opposition congressman, fernando olivera, said he
received  a letter smuggled from prison by luis frank aybar, who
claimed  his brother was being tortured to prevent him from
implicating  montesinos in the smuggling.
aybar  said his brother was held in a military base, ''a victim
of  beatings and torture to make him accept his guilt and not to
mention  dr. montesinos at all,'' according to the letter, which
olivera  distributed to the press.
critics  say the announcement that montesinos broke the ring was
an  attempt to divert blame for the arms shipments. colombia says it
alerted  peru to the smuggling months before the announcement.
fujimori  has vehemently rejected any suggestions of government
misconduct,  saying, ''the sale, i repeat, was not to the armed
forces  of peru.''
u.s.  officials have been careful to remain neutral about the
arms  deal. the scandal comes as the united states is seeking to
unite  the hemisphere behind plan colombia, which is costing
washington  $1.3 billion to fight the colombian drug trade, and
indirectly,  guerrilla groups that finance their insurgencies
through  drug money.
mirko  lauer, a top political columnist for newspaper la
republica,  said montesinos' flight to panama may also have been
motivated  by the fast-unraveling arms scandal.
''perhaps  montesinos didn't fly the coop so much to save himself
from  the demands of the peruvian judicial process, but to avoid
deepening  accusations about arms trafficking to the farc,'' lauer
recently  wrote.

[TEXT]
austin,  texas (ap)-- roy williams caught a 96-yard touchdown pass
and  kenny hayter rushed for 122 yards against the nation's toughest
run  defense as no. 13 texas beat oklahoma state 42-7.
major  applewhite passed for 291 yards and three touchdowns to
lead  texas (3-1, 1-0 big 12).
on  the day the school retired former heisman trophy winner ricky
williams'  jersey, the longhorns overcame a sluggish first half that
included  a blocked punt to produce its best offensive game of the
season.
 reggie  white led oklahoma state (2-2, 0-1) with 104 yards
rushing,  most of them coming on a 69-yard run in the first quarter.
williams'  touchdown catch broke open a 10-7 game in the third
quarter.  on third-and-14, williams broke behind the secondary and
applewhite,  who had been sacked one play earlier, laid out a soft
pass  for him to run under down the right sideline.
williams,  whose 36-yard catch in the second quarter set up
texas'  first touchdown, set a longhorns freshman record with 175
yards  on five receptions.
oklahoma  state came into the game ranked no. 1 against the run,
allowing  just 30.3 yards per game. with hayter pounding the ball up
the  middle, texas finished with a season-high 205 yards rushing.
after  a fumble by oklahoma state quarterback tony lindsay led to
kris  stockton's 20-yard field goal, applewhite found artie ellis
for  21-yard touchdown pass to put texas ahead 26-7.
in  the fourth quarter, applewhite connected with montrell
flowers  from 2 yards out and ivan williams added a late touchdown
run  for the longhorns.
texas  took a long time to get its offense going. the longhorns
had  trouble moving the ball early and managed just one
first-quarter  first down. the longhorns led 3-0 after stockton's
44-yard  field goal, but failed to score an offensive touchdown in
the  first quarter for the seventh straight game.
the  texas defense, however, was dominant early. oklahoma state
started  drives inside texas territory four times and came away with
only  one touchdown, a 9-yard run by white in the second quarter
after  the cowboys blocked a texas punt.
cowboys  kicker seth condley missed a 32-yard field goal attempt
in  the first quarter and had a 38-yarder blocked on the last play
of  the half.
leading  7-3, oklahoma state had a chance to increase its lead
when  the cowboys stuffed a texas fake punt on the longhorns' 38.
but  after two short runs by white and an incomplete pass, oklahoma
state  was forced to punt.
texas  also got an early break when a cowboys interception return
to  inside the longhorns 10 was negated by a personal foul.

[TEXT]
fayetteville,  ark. (ap) -- jamie henderson scored on a 35-yard
interception  return on arkansas' first play as no. 25 georgia beat
the  razorbacks 38-7 on saturday.
the  bulldogs (3-1, 1-1 sec) did it with a defense that held
arkansas  (3-1, 1-1) to one first down during the first 28 minutes
and  a running game that pounded the razorbacks up front.
georgia  quarterback quincy carter made a well-timed pitch on
bruce  thornton's 21-yard touchdown run that increased the lead to
24-0  at the half and completed some important passes, but he also
missed  some open receivers.
the  loss was the first for arkansas inside the state borders
since  houston nutt took over as coach -- a string of 15 games. the
razorbacks  were without their top two tailbacks, cedric cobbs and
fred  talley, who were hurt last week against alabama. alvin ray, a
third  teamer last week, gained 1 yard on five first-half carries.
the  bulldogs made 13 first downs in the first half and held the
ball  almost 18&amp;frac12; minutes. arkansas managed five first downs and 105
yards  in the first three quarters and trailed 38-0 at that point.
georgia  scored 10 points during a 17-second span in the first
quarter.
 billy  bennett ended the bulldogs' first possession with a
39-yard  field goal. the razorbacks went without a huddle on their
first  play, splitting two receivers to the left and leaving ray
alone  behind the quarterback. robby hampton backed up a couple of
steps  and look to the left sideline for boo williams. henderson
intercepted  cleanly in front of williams and scored easily.
georgia  drove 54 yards for its second touchdown after richard
smith  made a fair catch of a punt at the arkansas 7 and the
razorbacks  couldn't get out of the hole.
sanks  and thornton ran for two first downs and carter fooled
arkansas  with a first-down play fake and a pass to randy mcmichael
for  a 7-yard gain. sanks and thornton carried once each for a first
down  at the 10 before a penalty moved the ball back to the 15.
damien  gary made a sliding catch at the 2. sanks was hit in the
backfield,  but he spun, kept his balance and crawled over a couple
of  players to the end zone.
carter  started the bulldogs' third touchdown drive with a short
pass  that brett millican turned into a 20-yard gain. on third-and-2
from  the arkansas 21, carter started left on the option. he waited
until  derrick johnson committed and then pitched to thornton who
cut  inside a defender on his way to the end zone.
the  razorbacks couldn't make a first down on their first two
possessions  of the second half and the bulldogs only had to cover
44  yards for a 31-0 lead. the defense reacted to carter rolling
left  and gary worked open in the middle. corey harris missed a
tackle,  gary got to the right sideline and jevaris johnson screened
the  final defender.

[HEADLINE] :  christian coalition gets bush video
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- george w. bush reaffirmed his support for the
christian  coalition's values saturday in a three-minute videotaped
address  meant to soothe any hard feelings created by his absence
from  their convention.
''should  i be elected, i will lead our nation toward a culture
that  values life, the life of the elderly and the sick, the life of
the  young and the life of the unborn,'' bush said. he didn't
explain  why he initially hadn't intended to speak.
addressing  abortion, which is high on the list of concerns at
the  convention, bush said good people disagree on the issue, but
everyone  should seek ways to promote adoption and parental
notification.
 ''and  when congress sends me a bill against partial-birth
abortion,  i will sign it into law,'' he added.
bush  outlined his support for cutting taxes, restoring
children's  moral values and reforming social security and
education.
 ''like  ronald reagan, i believe that the freedom we cherish
ultimately  depends on the values our families teach,'' bush said.
dede  robertson, wife of christian coalition founder pat
robertson,  echoed her husband's earlier warning that bush shouldn't
take  their support for granted. speaking before bush addressed the
crowd,  she criticized both parties.
''we  have one candidate who changes his personality every now
and  then and then we have another candidate who has distanced
himself  from his supporters and pals around with john mccain,'' she
said.
 christian  coalition members attending the convention were more
sympathetic  to bush.
''we  are the choir here,'' said tonnie dunmoyer, a real estate
broker  from hemet, calif. ''he doesn't have to come here because we
are  for him. he should be out there stumping to talk to people.''
bruce  friedman, an engineer from brandon, fla., agreed.
''i  would have liked to see george bush here in person, but i
know  that he is out campaigning. i don't think he would have
changed  anyone's mind in this room,'' he said. bush was in
crawford,  texas preparing for the first presidential debate.
bush's  unscheduled address surprised many in attendance, who
were  unclear there would be a videotaped message on two giant
television  screens. when the texas governor was announced and the
lights  dimmed, many in attendance rose to applaud expecting bush to
walk  on stage.
the  audience gave their loudest applause to alan keyes, a former
contender  for the republican presidential nomination.
keyes  said moral outrage over the clinton administration was key
to  the republicans winning the white house, conceding that in
prosperous  times it was virtually impossible to defeat an incumbent
on  just economic issues.
''if  voters go into the voting booth thinking about material
things,  we are going to suffer a material and bitter defeat,'' he
said.
 reform  party candidate pat buchanan, who has spoken at past
conventions  but was not invited this year, later held his own rally
in  the same hotel.
republicans  in past years have counted on the christian
coalition  to help get out the vote across the country, but bush has
focused  more on moderates and swing voters. some in the party have
been  concerned that buchanan could drain away religious
conservatives.
 while  not mentioning him by name, buchanan didn't overlook
bush's  absence.
''are  we supporting folks who will not stand with us?'' buchanan
asked  about 100 supporters. ''if they won't come speak to you, they
won't  speak about these ideas, they won't talk about these issues,
can  you trust them to fight for you once they get in the white
house?''
 directing  his comments to bush, he added: ''why don't you try
sending  a video tape to the ballot box?''

washington  (ap) -- javarus dudley's 97-yard kickoff return
snapped  a third-quarter tie as fordham beat georgetown 17-10 on
saturday.
 dudley  also caught mike mucci's 18-yard touchdown pass, and
arthur  gaskin rushed for 108 yards to help the rams (2-3) end a
two-game  losing streak.
gharun  hester scored the hoyas' only touchdown on a 45-yard pass
from  david paulus. georgetown (2-2), which will join fordham in the
patriot  league next season, has lost six consecutive games to the
rams  since 1983.
fordham's  defense constantly pressured paulus, who was sacked
eight  times and threw four interceptions. georgetown was held to 13
yards  rushing.
paulus  completed 13 of 30 passes for 148 yards, and mucci was
18-for-31  for 149 yards.
the  decisive score came on the kickoff after a 48-yard field
goal  by georgetown's mark samuel forced a 10-10 tie with 10:57 left
in  the third quarter.
dudley  took samuel's high kickoff at the fordham 3, scampered up
the  right sideline then cut back across the field en route to the
rams'  first kickoff return for a score since 1996.
georgetown  turned the ball over twice in the first quarter as
the  rams took a 10-0 lead.
nine  plays after kyle shanton intercepted paulus' pass, brian
colsant  kicked a 22-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead with 7:21
remaining  in the quarter.
a  play after brad fradenburg's interception, mucci threw a
19-yard  td pass to dudley.
the  hoyas, who were held to minus-6 yards rushing in the first
half,  cut the lead to 10-7 on 45-yard pass down the middle from
paulus  to hester 1:33 into the second quarter.

victory  over massachusetts saturday.
butler,  who had four touchdown passes in hofstra's first four
games  this season, completed 22 of 32 passes for 324 yards without
an  interception.
he  gave hofstra (4-1) a 14-0 lead early in the first quarter
with  an 18-yard touchdown pass to adams and a 1-yard run after doug
shanahan's  interception.
butler  threw two more touchdown passes in the first half after
fumbled  punts by massachusetts (2-2) to give hofstra a 28-17
halftime  lead. kevin quinlan scored on 28 and 15-yard runs for
massachusetts  in the half.
hofstra  pulled away in the second half when butler threw a
15-yard  touchdown pass to jason maxwell and a 40-yarder to steve
jackson  and shanahan returned an interception 46 yards for a
touchdown.
 massachusetts'  richard lucero was 22-for-36 for 311 yards and
three  touchdowns, but also had three interceptions. adrian zullo
had  seven catches for 115 yards and two touchdowns.

[HEADLINE] :  va judge: inmates can get dna test
[TEXT]
alexandria,  va. (ap) -- inmates who claim they were wrongfully
convicted  have a constitutional right to request dna testing that
might  prove their innocence, a federal judge ruled.
u.s.  district judge albert v. bryan jr. issued the ruling friday
in  the case of james harvey, 59, who was convicted of rape in 1990.
bryan  did not order dna testing for harvey but said the 14th
amendment  allows state prisoners to file federal civil rights
lawsuits  seeking dna testing.
although  a district judge's decision is not binding on other
courts,  harvey's lawsuit could become a national test case.
''dna  testing is becoming so accurate that any intelligent judge
is  going to say, 'if there's any doubt, you should have a right to
test.'  if they can prove your guilt, why can't you prove your
nonguilt?''  said john whitehead, president of the rutherford
institute,  a conservative civil liberties group that is not
involved  in the harvey case.
if  bryan's decision reaches higher courts and is upheld, it
could  unleash a flood of lawsuits, the washington post reported
saturday.  most jurisdictions, including virginia, do not guarantee
prisoners  the right to post-conviction dna testing. instead,
prisoners  must depend on prosecutors and governors to grant access
to  the laboratory work they claim could clear them.
jack  gould, an attorney for fairfax commonwealth's attorney
robert  f. horan jr., whose rejection of harvey's request prompted
the  lawsuit, said the arguments the judge addressed were technical
arguments.  ''there will be further proceedings,'' he said.
post-conviction  dna testing has freed more than 70 prisoners,
including  eight from death rows, but a national debate is raging
over  how widely to make the technology available.
harvey  was convicted of a 1989 rape in which a woman was raped
and  beaten by two men. no dna testing was done at the time, and the
witness  was unable to identify her attackers; the key evidence came
from  a man who said harvey had confessed to him.
fairfax  officials turned down harvey's initial request for dna
testing,  saying a negative result would not prove his innocence
because  there were two assailants.
gould  argued that harvey's civil rights lawsuit to get dna
testing  was an attempt to get around the strict rules of criminal
appeals  and virginia's one-year deadline for filing a habeas corpus
appeal  arguing he was wrongly imprisoned.
but  the federal judge wrote that harvey may still have a
constitutional  right to testing. denial of dna testing is a new
civil  rights claim and separate from the strictly regulated habeas
corpus  process, bryan wrote.
''this  is a very good sign,'' said barry scheck, co-founder of
the  new york-based innocence project, which represents harvey and
other  prisoners who claim they were wrongly convicted. ''we can't
ever  get into state court because of the statute of limitations.
we've  lost in many places because it's too late.''

12  palestinians killed in clashes
jerusalem  (ap) -- israeli troops battling several gunmen and thousands of
rock-throwing  palestinians opened fire saturday, killing 12 palestinians in the
bloodiest  clashes in the west bank and gaza strip since 1996. more than 500
palestinians  were injured, the palestinian health minister said. among those
killed  was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the cross fire. cowering behind
his  father, he screamed in panic as shots hit a wall just inches above their
heads.  seconds later, the boy was fatally shot in the abdomen.
fbi  expands probe of bush debate tape
washington  (ap) -- the fbi has expanded its investigation to determine if
superiors  of an employee of a bush media consultant were involved in sending a
bush  debate tape to his democratic opponent, a federal law enforcement official
said  today. the bureau has opened a full criminal investigation of debate
preparation  materials for george w. bush that were mailed to a confidante of al
gore,  the official said. ''i'm confident that nobody who supports my candidacy
would  have mailed the tape,'' bush said today from his ranch in crawford, texas,
where  he was preparing for the first debate with aides. ''i look forward to
finding  out who it is.''
candidates  prepare for first debate
austin,  texas (ap) -- al gore and george w. bush dug into intense
preparations  today for the first presidential debate, honing styles and
strategies  for trumping the other guy in confrontations five weeks before the
election.  for democrat gore, the road to boston on tuesday led through sarasota,
fla.  republican bush's path led through his ranch in crawford, texas. for both
men,  the event is an opportunity to introduce themselves to americans only now
tuning  in what could be the closest election since 1960. issues ranging from
abortion,  oil prices, health care, social security and education to voting
records  and reputations provide fodder for attacks on such matters as gore's
penchant  for exaggeration and bush's ability to lead.
russia  offers yugoslavia mediation
belgrade,  yugoslavia (ap) -- russia offered saturday to try and mediate the
showdown  between slobodan milosevic and opposition forces, but secretary of
state  madeleine albright said the russians should accept his sept. 24 election
defeat  and send a message that milosevic is ''finished.'' there was no official
reaction  to the russian offer. but at a speech today, milosevic said: ''we alone
will  decide our fate.'' thousands of opposition supporters gathered in belgrade
this  evening to hear their leaders announce a general strike for monday and a
limited  road blockade tomorrow as a ''dress rehearsal.''
priest  takes ax to ill. abortion clinic
rockford,  ill. (ap) -- a catholic priest smashed his car into an abortion
clinic  this morning, then chopped at the building with an ax until the owner
fired  two shotgun blasts to stop him, police said. the clinic was not open and
nobody  was injured in the attack, which came just two days after federal
approval  of the abortion pill ru-486. the rev. john earl, 32, was arrested and
charged  with burglary and felony criminal damage to property, police said.
abortion  providers say they are usually are on alert for violence following
abortion-related  events in the news.

[HEADLINE] :  indians 6, blue jays 5
[TEXT]
cleveland  (ap) -- nothing has been easy for the cleveland indians
this  season. it didn't start that way, and it won't end that way,
either.
 chuck  finley got his sixth win in september and roberto alomar
hit  a disputed homer as cleveland put the pressure on seattle and
oakland  in the al wild card race, holding on for a 6-5 victory
saturday  over the toronto blue jays.
manny  ramirez also homered as the indians moved within a
half-game  of the mariners for the wild card, and pulled one game
behind  the athletics, who lead the al west.
seattle  was at anaheim on saturday afternoon, and the a's played
host  to texas.
cleveland,  which coasted into the postseason the past five
years,  will now play a 162nd game that could mean a sixth
consecutive  trip to the playoffs. but to stay alive in the playoff
picture,  they'll probably have to beat toronto's david wells on
sunday.
 wells,  a longtime indians' nemesis, is 17-3 -- including 4-0 in
the  postseason -- with a 3.08 era in his career against cleveland.
he's  2-0 with 0.53 era in 17 innings against the indians this year.
but  in getting to sunday, the indians nearly blew a pair of
three-run  leads for finley (16-11) and used four relievers to get
out  of the eighth alone when toronto scored twice to close to 6-5.
with  the tying run at second and two outs, cameron cairncross
got  darrin fletcher to ground out to first.
bob  wickman, the indians' seventh pitcher, worked the ninth for
his  14th save.
even  the final out wasn't easy. with a runner on second and two
outs,  wickman intentionally walked carlos delgado before retiring
tony  batista on a grounder that shortstop omar vizquel backhanded
in  the hole to end it.
cleveland  led 4-3 in the seventh when alomar sliced a 3-1 pitch
around  the left-field foul pole for his 19th homer. toronto manager
jim  fregosi stormed out of the dugout to argue the ball was foul,
but  after discussing it for several minutes, the umpiring crew
decided  it was a homer.
tv  replays were inconclusive, and fregosi was ejected.
ramirez  followed with his 37th homer -- and 10th in 22 games -- to
put  the indians up 6-3.
finley  has been everything the indians could have hoped for down
the  stretch. he allowed two runs and five hits in six-plus innings
while  pitching on three days' rest for the second time in three
starts.
 the  indians snapped a 1-1 tie with a three-run sixth off esteban
loaiza  (10-13) with some help from blue jays catcher alberto
castillo,  who made two throwing errors.
alomar  beat out an infield single and went to second when
castillo's  attempted pickoff throw skipped away from delgado.
ramirez  singled alomar to third where he scored on jim thome's
groundout.  travis fryman singled and loaiza was pulled after
walking  david segui to load the bases.
kelvim  escobar came in and walked russell branyan to force in a
run,  giving the indians a 3-1 lead. sandy alomar then grounded into
a  force at the plate but he was safe and segui scored when delgado
couldn't  handle a return throw from castillo.
the  blue jays closed to 4-3 in the seventh against reliever paul
shuey  on fletcher's pinch-hit rbi single and shannon stewart's
run-scoring  grounder.
notes:  finley hadn't won 16 games since 1993. ... delgado's double
in  the eighth was his 99th extra-base hit. he needs one more to
become  the 12th player in history with 100 extra-base hits in a
season.  ... wickman had six splinters removed from his right hand
after  he was hit by the barrel of corey koskie's shattered bat in
thursday's  loss to minnesota.

[HEADLINE] :  syria's assad readies for trip
[TEXT]
cairo,  egypt (ap) -- after two months spent shoring up his
position  at home, syrian president bashar assad is shifting his
attention  to a critical regional concern he so far has only tiptoed
around  -- making peace with israel.
assad  is expected in cairo on sunday for his first foreign trip
since  his inauguration on july 17, succeeding his late father hafez
assad.  the 35-year-old president is expected to meet egyptian
president  hosni mubarak, a key mediator in arab-israeli
peacemaking.
 since  coming to power, bashar assad has been tackling domestic
issues  -- corruption and syria's weak economy -- amid concerns over
the  transition after the june 10 death of his father, who was a
dominant  figure in the middle east for 30 years.
''staying  out of headlines so far should be a cause of
satisfaction,''  patrick clawson, an analyst with the washington
institute  for near east policy, said from washington. ''but if he
goes  six months without action on the peace process, then there
will  be concern.''
after  hafez assad's death, his brother rifaat, known to have
presidential  aspirations, began grumbling aloud that the younger
assad  was not syria's rightful leader; the military was put on
alert  in case rifaat should try to return.
lebanon  also was cause for concern. israeli troops ended their
occupation  of southern lebanon barely two weeks before the elder
assad's  death. hezbollah guerrillas moved into their place, leading
to  worries cross-border fighting would erupt if the young president
weakened  syria's controlling hand.
but  rifaat stayed away and hezbollah proved a stabilizing force
along  the lebanon-israeli border.
''it's  remarkable how peaceful and calm the transition has
been,''  said analyst stephen cohen, a new york-based analyst with
the  israeli policy forum. ''it is a great contribution to the peace
process.''
 assad  and mubarak will discuss the middle east peace process,
egyptian  foreign minister amr moussa told reporters saturday, along
with  other arab issues including iraq and bilateral relations.
syrian-israeli  peace negotiations broke down in january, with
syria  demanding a full withdrawal from the golan heights, a
strategic  plateau captured by israel in 1967. israel insists on
waiting  to settle borders until it knows what it will gain by
returning  golan land.
assad  has made it clear he intends to follow his father's course
in  any negotiations with the jewish state. ''we have the urge to
reach  a state of peace, but we have no urge to compromise an inch
of  our territory,'' he said in his inauguration speech.
lebanon,  where syria has 30,000 troops and wields great
political  influence, is assad's other main regional challenge.
with  the end of israel's occupation in southern lebanon -- long
the  outward justification for syrian troops' presence in the
country  -- some lebanese want to loosen the strings.
like  his father before him, assad maintains the loyalty of the
vast  majority of leading lebanese politicians, including most
winners  of recent parliamentary elections. but since hafez assad's
death,  some leading lebanese christians have called on syria to
withdraw  its troops. last week, lebanon's largest church -- the
maronite  catholic church -- echoed the demand.
assad's  most concrete steps thus far have been on the domestic
front,  where syrians have high expectations he can modernize an
economy  and bureaucracy bound by years of socialist regulations.
assad's  government has announced a $1.08 billion vocational
program  hoped to help ease unemployment, which reached its highest
point  last year -- 9.5 percent according to official figures and 20
percent  unofficially. assad has stepped up a campaign against
government  corruption, resulting in the resignations of several top
legislators  and the imprisonment of two ministers.
''he  is one of the new generation of arab leaders, who looks at
modernization,  economic development and the west not as a colonial
imposition  but as something these countries can use in order to
become  equal parties in global development,'' said cohen of the
israeli  policy forum.

[HEADLINE] :  report: ioc gifts included viagra
[TEXT]
salt  lake city (ap) -- gifts to international olympic committee
delegates  by salt lake olympic officials ranged from a violin to
viagra,  a newspaper reported saturday.
favors  and gifts such as free medical care and paid vacations
were  reported shortly after the salt lake scandal became public in
late  1998.
other  gifts included the 1995 purchase of a violin, in violation
of  ioc rules, and the brokering of viagra prescriptions for two ioc
members  visiting salt lake city in june 1998 to study ski slopes
and  skating rinks, the salt lake tribune reported.
the  day before the opening ceremony for the summer games in
sydney,  salt lake olympic committee president mitt romney warned
ioc  members to brace for further embarrassments as more details
become  public and the federal bribery case against former top bid
committee  officials tom welch and dave johnson goes to trial next
year.
 some  ioc members responded with the threat of a lawsuit. members
were  also upset in may when sloc released a copy of the ''geld''
memo,  in which the salt lake bid committee hinted at inducements
such  as jobs, bow ties and medical treatment that could be given to
specific  members to win their support.
but  the tribune reported that a handwritten 1998 memo detailed a
june  visit to salt lake city by 20 members of the ioc coordination
commission.
 according  to the memorandum, sloc employee van alford drove two
visiting  ioc members -- only one is identified -- to a salt lake city
urologist  to obtain a viagra prescription for one of them. then
alford  gave the delegate $1,000 to buy the medication, used to
treat  erectile dysfunction, the newspaper said.
the  paper did not have a copy of the memo, but said it was on
file  at sloc.
citing  unidentified sources, the tribune also reported that the
other  ioc member also obtained a prescription for 10 to 20 viagra
tablets.
 the  tribune did not identify either official since the
transaction  was not illegal and involved a private medical matter.
neither  alford nor the ioc would comment on the story. sloc
spokeswoman  caroline shaw said the committee will not comment on
medical  records.
the  viagra purchase occurred a year after welch resigned from
sloc  in the wake of a domestic violence charge. johnson, however,
remained  a key member of salt lake city's olympic machine.
welch  and johnson, indicted in july on 15 counts of fraud,
bribery  and conspiracy, are two of five people federal prosecutors
have  linked in an alleged scheme to funnel more than $1 million to
the  ioc. welch and johnson maintain everything they did was
sanctioned  by bid committee trustees.
another  document reportedly on file at sloc is a may 17, 1995,
reimbursement  for a $524.47 violin that employee jason gull had
purchased  and the document said was given to gen. zein gadir, an
ioc  member from sudan. gadir was expelled by the ioc four months
after  the scandal broke for having accepted more than $20,000 in
cash  and scholarships from salt lake bid officials.
the  gift violates an ioc policy prohibiting gifts of more than
$150.

[HEADLINE] :  us, eu delay trade tax sanctions
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- a last-minute agreement saturday with the
european  union gives the united states until nov. 1 to replace a $4
billion  annual tax break for american companies that sell goods
abroad,  from giants microsoft and boeing to small businesses.
the  clinton administration was negotiating against a sunday
deadline  for bringing u.s. tax laws into compliance with an adverse
ruling  from the world trade organization. the dispute involves the
biggest  case the united states has lost before the geneva-based
arbiter  of world trade rules.
congress  now has until nov. 1 to pass the legislation. the eu
agreed  not to impose any economic penalties until a wto panel
determines  whether the new tax system complies with wto rules.
a  top senate republican, finance committee chairman william roth
of  delaware, said he was hopeful congress would approve the
legislation  ''in very short order.''
at  issue is a u.s. tax program that grants $4.1 billion in
annual  tax breaks to 6,000 american companies which set up export
subsidiaries  in offshore tax havens such as the virgin islands and
barbados.
 the  wto in february ruled that it was an illegal export subsidy.
''the  united states and european union today demonstrated a
commitment  to avoid escalating trans-atlantic trade tensions and
managing  this wto trade dispute responsibly,'' u.s. trade
representative  charlene barshefsky said in a statement.
in  a separate statement, pascal lamy, europe's top trade
negotiator,  said, ''our priority is to resolve disputes, not
exacerbate  them.''
lamy,  however, repeated the eu position that the legislation,
which  has passed the house, still would violate international trade
laws.
 the  foreign sales corporation program was created in 1984 to
enable  u.s. companies, including microsoft, boeing, general motors
and  united technologies, to reduce u.s. corporate income taxes by
15  percent by creating export subsidiaries.
the  program was intended to offset an eu tax rebate given to
european  companies for products sold overseas. the replacement
legislation  would create new tax breaks that would apply equally to
u.s.  exports and to products the companies manufacture in their
overseas  plants.
the  extension gives congress more time to complete work on the
replacement  legislation and helps to defuse trade tensions between
the  united states and the eu, the world's two largest trading
partners.
 groundwork  for the compromise was laid last month when president
clinton  agreed to a request by british prime minister tony blair to
delay  penalties against some european products, possibly including
british  cashmere.
that  dispute with the eu is over barriers the europeans have
erected  to sale of bananas from american-run plantations in the
caribbean  and south america and the import of american beef treated
with  growth hormones.
the  united states has imposed $308 million in penalties on a
variety  of european luxury goods -- danish ham, german chocolate,
french  mustard, roquefort cheese -- in an effort to get europe to
drop  its barriers and comply with the wto rulings in those cases.
to  increase pressure, congress this year ordered the
administration  to rotate the target list periodically.
efforts  to bring the replacement tax legislation for debate were
blocked  last week by senate democrats. the dispute centers on
republican  efforts to limit amendments and democrats' insistence on
their  right to offer them -- even those dealing with unrelated
topics  such campaign finance reform or the minimum wage.
a  senior u.s. trade official, speaking on condition of
anonymity,  expressed optimism that congress would approve the
legislation  by the new deadline.
a  challenge by the eu would take at least six months. if the eu
were  to win its case against replacement legislation, only then
could  it push for clearance to file for penalties.
that  would mean that any penalties on u.s. imports would not
appear  until next summer at the earliest. the eu, however, is
expected  to publish a preliminary target list by late november.
that  list is likely to include a far larger amount of u.s.
exports  from which the eu will later choose items totaling the $4
billion  in economic harm it claims to be suffering.

[HEADLINE] :  final rnc demonstrators enter pleas
[TEXT]
philadelphia  (ap) -- the last of the nearly 300 people charged
with  misdemeanors stemming from demonstrations during the
republican  national convention entered guilty pleas or demanded
trials  saturday.
in  three saturdays of special hearings, 185 of those arrested
for  crimes such blocking traffic or disorderly conduct have chosen
trial,  106 accepted plea agreements -- a $300 fine and six months
probation,  with no legal record of the offense -- and warrants were
issued  for a few who failed to appear, said cathie abookire, a
spokeswoman  for district attorney lynne m. abraham.
several  defendants read statements while about 60 supporters,
many  holding banners reading ''resist,'' silently raised their
fists  in the courtroom.
jacob  reed said he chose to go to trial because he made a moral
judgment  to protest and ''for that reason i can't voluntarily pay
retribution.''
 ''it's  a moment of truth, a day in court. that's what we were
after  in the street,'' said george ripley, 52, of washington, d.c.
trials  were scheduled over the next three months for those
facing  misdemeanor charges.
the  demonstrators' causes during the convention included the
death  penalty, police brutality, the influence of corporations and
big-money  contributors over u.s. elections, and the corporate
dominance  of a global economy that demonstrators say threatens the
effectiveness  of u.s. labor and environmental protections.

[TEXT]
havana  (ap) -- the kids got to stay up all night and the adults
passed  around a bottle of rum as family and friends crowded around
the  television in felix savon's home to watch him became just the
third  boxer to win three olympic gold medals.
''my  papa won! my papa won!'' 6-year-old felix mario shouted
after  watching his dad beat russia's sultanahmed ibzagimov in the
early  hours of saturday via a live television broadcast from
sydney.  ''i'm not going to be a baseball player anymore. i'm going
to  be a boxer like him!''
felix  mario's twin sister maria felix was hiding.
''she  gets scared when she sees her papa in the ring,'' said the
children's  mother, maria.
''i  am happy, very happy, i cannot find the words,'' said
savon's  wife, wiping away her tears. ''i cannot find the words.''
weeping,  too, was savon's sister marianela, who could only think
of  their father who died six years ago. ''this title is for my
papa!''  she shouted. ''i am sure that wherever he is, he has
helped.''
 marianela  was jittery all through the fight, jumping up and
running  out after each round. occasionally, the sound of a bell
could  be heard coming from the patio, where followers of an
afro-cuban  religion called on the supernatural to lend a hand.
meanwhile,  savon's 53-year-old cousin armando didn't move from
in  front of the television, holding a glass of rum in one hand and
using  the other to show cousin felix just how to hit the russian.
savon's  wife said the twins and their 4-year-old brother,
draysel,  have watched all of their father's fights, no matter what
the  hour. ''it is very important that they know who their father
is,''  she said.
after  an early morning of shouts, tears, and rum, the savon
family  and friends joined in a countdown at the end of the battle.
''six!  five! four! three! two! one! zero!''
and  with that, savon joined fellow cuban heavyweight teofilo
stevenson  as a three-time olympic boxing gold champion. the third
three-gold  fighter was hungary's lazlo papp.

jacksonville,  fla. (ap) -- jacksonville's jonathan turner blocked
a  punt, then recovered it for a touchdown and the dolphins' defense
forced  seven turnovers as jacksonville ended a seven-game losing
streak  with a 28-24 win over austin peay saturday.
jacksonville  (1-3) recovered six of austin peay's nine fumbles
in  the game played in a steady, heavy rain. the dolphins forced a
turnover  on all five austin peay possessions in the third quarter.
ju  converted three of those miscues into touchdowns, including a
32-yard  run by jon underhill. that bettered underhill's 30-yard
jaunt  in the first quarter, the team's first scrimmage run over 20
yards  this year.
turner's  punt block for a touchdown early in the third quarter
erased  the governors' 12-7 halftime lead. it marked the first time
in  school history that the dolphins had scored a touchdown off a
blocked  punt.
austin  peay (0-4) battled back in the fourth quarter behind a
pair  of brian baker touchdown passes to mike farrell and mike ogg.
the  governors failed to convert on any of their four extra-point
tries,  missing a kick and three 2-point conversion attempts.

st.  louis (ap) -- pat hentgen became the latest st. louis starter
to  get hit hard before the playoffs as osvaldo fernandez pitched
the  cincinnati reds past the cardinals 8-4 saturday.
the  central champion cardinals and east champion atlanta will
start  their best-of-5 series tuesday, although where they open
remains  in question.
the  team with the best record gets the home-field advantage. st.
louis  and atlanta, which played visiting colorado at night, began
the  day with the same record -- if they end up tied, the cardinals
get  the edge because they won the season series 4-3.
fernandez  (4-3) allowed four hits in seven scoreless innings. he
won  a day after cincinnati's ron villone struck out 16 in beating
garrett  stephenson and the cardinals 8-1.
the  cardinals scored four times in the ninth. mark mcgwire had a
pinch-hit,  rbi single and carlos hernandez hit a three-run homer.
hentgen  (15-12) was battered in his final postseason tuneup,
allowing  five runs on eight hits in four innings. he has struggled
his  last two starts, allowing 11 runs in nine innings.
jason  larue had a two-run homer in the fourth, singled and
scored  three runs for the reds. brian hunter had two singles, stole
two  bases, scored twice and walked twice.
sean  casey also drove in two runs with an rbi single in the
first  and a run-scoring groundout in the third.
fernandez's  only other appearance at busch stadium was the
shortest  of his career. he gave up three runs on six hits in 1 1-3
innings  july 6, then went on the disabled list for two months with
an  elbow injury the next day.
notes:  thanks to the acquisition of ken griffey jr., the reds
broke  the major league road attendance record previously held by
the  1993 braves. they've played in front of 37 sellout crowds and a
total  of 2,968,541 fans, 24,000 more than the braves with one
sellout  to go on sunday. the sellout of 47,099 was the 36th at
busch  stadium this season. ... chris stynes doubled in the second
and  is 15-for-37 (.405) with four homers and nine rbis during a
10-game  hitting streak. ... the reds have won their last three on
the  road after losing four in a row. ... dmitri young's pinch-hit
single  in the reds sixth marked his first rbi in nine games, ending
his  longest dry spell of the season.

[HEADLINE] :  utah's smith refuses soft money ban
[TEXT]
salt  lake city (ap) -- republican derek smith has refused
democrat  jim matheson's challenge to ban soft money advertising in
their  race for utah's 2nd district congressional seat.
with  both parties battling for control of the house of
representatives,  the national republican congressional committee
has  spent nearly $1 million on ''issue ads'' backing smith, while
the  democratic congressional campaign committee has spent $250,000
on  similar ads for matheson.
matheson  called for the ban on tuesday, but smith refused,
arguing  on friday that there is nothing wrong with the party
spending  money to highlight issues important to salt lake valley
voters.  smith also accused matheson of making the pitch to avoid
being  aligned with his own party.
soft  money refers to unlimited funds collected by political
parties.  while hard money contributions, limited to $2,000 per
donor,  can be used for ads that advocate voting for or against a
candidate,  soft money can only be used to advocate an issue, boost
a  candidate or attack a candidate rather than stating: vote for
this  candidate.
first  lady hillary rodham clinton and rep. rick lazio have
agreed  to call for a ban on soft money in their new york senate
race,  but that agreement has been criticized since there is no way
to  enforce it.
keeping  soft money out of the utah race would work to matheson's
advantage.  he had raised more than $720,000 as of the last
reporting  period on june 30. smith had raised only $15,000 and
spent  nearly all he had, plus $620,000 of his own money, to beat
rep.  merrill cook in the republican primary.
two  polls show matheson with a lead, but neither campaign is
putting  much weight in the numbers.

newark,  n.j. (ap) -- an electrical explosion and fire burned two
workers  saturday, one critically, in a building at newark
international  airport, while a mock disaster drill was underway
outside.
 the  two were working in an electrical closet at a fedex building
when  a short circuit started the fire that set both workers'
clothing  ablaze, said steve coleman, a spokesman for the port
authority  of new york and new jersey, which runs the airport.
''they  tried to put the fire out on each other by rolling on the
ground,  but there was very little room on the floor of this room.
it  was about the size of a small coat closet,'' said coleman.
they  eventually got outside and put out the flames, and got help
from  teams from the university of medicine and dentistry of new
jersey  and union hospital who were participating in a mock plane
crash  disaster drill.
one  worker was released after treatment for burns on her hands

[HEADLINE] :  russia offers yugoslavia mediation
[TEXT]
belgrade,  yugoslavia (ap) -- preparing to face down the
opposition  in the streets, president slobodan milosevic on saturday
turned  down an offer of russian mediation, a u.s. official said.
the  defiant balkan leader declared yugoslavs themselves ''will
decide  our fate.''
milosevic  spoke as the opposition unveiled plans for what they
hope  will be nationwide work stoppages and blockades to force the
yugoslav  president to accept defeat by challenger vojislav
kostunica  in the sept. 24 election.
the  opposition claims kostunica won outright, but the government
insists  he failed to take enough votes to avoid a runoff next
sunday.  the federal electoral commission on saturday formally
rejected  all opposition challenges of alleged vote irregularities.
that  has raised fears of violence as the only way out of the
yugoslav  impasse.
in  an effort to ease the situation, russian president vladimir
putin  offered on saturday to send his foreign minister, igor
ivanov,  to belgrade to try to defuse the showdown. however,
secretary  of state madeleine albright, however, said the russians
should  accept milosevic's apparent defeat.
the  only message moscow should send, she said, was that the
yugoslav  president is ''finished.''
president  clinton reinforced that point later saturday in a
half-hour  telephone conversation with putin. according to p.j.
crowley,  the spokesman for the national security council, ''both
leaders  agreed that it is important for milosevic to accept the
will  of the serbian people.''
according  to crowley, putin told clinton that his offer to send
ivanov  to meet both milosevic and kostunica had been rejected.
there  was no official statement from the government whether
milosevic  had rejected the russian offer. but at a speech saturday
to  the yugoslav military academy, milosevic said: ''we alone will
decide  our fate.''
thousands  of opposition supporters gathered in belgrade on
saturday  night to hear their leaders announce a general strike for
monday  and a limited road blockade sunday as a ''dress rehearsal.''
''no  more big words, speeches and rallies,'' said vuk obradovic,
a  former army general and now milosevic opponent. ''our message to
the  police, to the army and to paramilitary units is that we are
not  afraid of them.''
obradovic  suggested that if milosevic sends his forces to
attack,  crowds from elsewhere in the country would converge on the
capital.  ''not a single drop of blood must be shed,'' he added.
''we  ask everybody to be peaceful and dignified.''
opposition  leaders, using figures from their poll watchers,
claim  kostunica won the election with 51.34 percent to 36.22
percent  for milosevic. but the federal electoral commission, in a
tally  criticized by the united states and other countries, says
kostunica  fell short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff oct.
8.
 milosevic  still controls the army and the police, traditional
pillars  of his power. seeking to shore up those bases, the yugoslav
president  addressed graduation ceremony saturday at the yugoslav
military  academy and congratulated the newly commissioned officers
for  serving ''at a time of great temptation for our people and
state.''
 in  his first public appearance since last weekend's election,
milosevic  reminded the military of its duty to defend ''our freedom
and  the independence of our country,'' which the government claims
is  at risk because of alleged western interference in the yugoslav
election.
 ''foreign  forces will not dare attack us again, unless they try
to  come here with an invitation from our domestic enemies,''
milosevic  said, referring to the opposition. ''since foreign
military  intervention or a war are out of the question, other means
of  destruction of yugoslavia are being mentioned -- psychological,
media  and political pressures.''
in  moscow, putin offered to send foreign minister igor ivanov to
belgrade  to meet with both sides. russia -- among yugoslavia's
strongest  allies -- has warned the west to avoid meddling in the
election.
 ''if  belgrade finds it possible, russia would be prepared to
play  a higher profile in the process of settlement and coordination
of  positions,'' putin said, according to the kremlin press service.
albright,  however, insisted the russians must tell milosevic it
was  time to give up power and that she would convey that message to
ivanov  by telephone.
''i  think the russians need to make clear that they understand
that  this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,'' she
told  reporters in reykjavik, iceland. ''the russians need to
understand  that milosevic lost in this round. he is finished. it is
time  for him to go.''
opposition  leaders have called for a peaceful civil disobedience
campaign,  hoping to avoid provoking milosevic into using the army
and  police against them.
scattered  protests and road blockades took place saturday in
various  parts of serbia. various professional associations have
also  pledged to support the opposition. university and high school
students  have announced they will join the general strike.
truckers,  farmers and workers blocked several roads in different
parts  of serbia saturday, some for only several hours as a warning
of  a broader blockade on monday.
miners  at the kolubara coal mine, workers in pancevo oil
refinery,  railroad workers in the western serbia have also decided
to  go on strike until the authorities acknowledge the opposition
victory.
 the  opposition had filed several complaints of alleged
irregularities,  chief among them that milosevic supporters packed
ballot  boxes in kosovo with thousands of votes purportedly from
kosovo  albanians. the united nations, which administers the
province,  said virtually all kosovo albanians boycotted the ballot.

[HEADLINE] :  report: crackdown delays promotions
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- a security crackdown, which has cost an
ambassador  his security clearances and forced former diplomats to
use  escorts inside the state department building, has led to
reviews  of security records of almost 400 employees who were up for
promotion,  it was reported saturday.
promotions  for more than 200 senior officials are held up during
the  review, and 200 midlevel officials' promotions were released
friday  after being delayed a week, the new york times said.
it  quoted marc grossman, director general of the foreign
service,  as saying he would review the remaining files for security
violations  before forwarding the promotions to the white house,
which  will forward them on to the senate. grossman told the
newspaper  that ''under 10'' officials had been barred from
promotions  because of results of the review.
a  state department statement given to the associated press on
saturday  said only that the incident and procedures were under
discussion.  officials declined further comment.
the  times said grossman was instituting a system to assess a
point  system, grading the seriousness of offenses and how long ago
they  were committed. too high a score would send a state department
employee  to remedial security courses.
security  in the department has been under a microscope after
strong  congressional criticism that followed lapses including the
theft  from within the building of a laptop computer holding
top-secret  files. despite a reward offer, the computer has not been
found.
 last  week, clearances of martin indyk, the u.s. ambassador to
israel  and a major participant in the middle east peace process,
were  suspended because of suspect security procedures. officials
said  espionage was not involved, just unfollowed security rules.
state  department spokesman richard boucher said last week that
five  employees in all had their clearances suspended for security
policy  violations this year. another 27 have had suspensions within
the  last two years, he said.
another  recent move, a requirement that retired diplomats be
escorted  inside the building, caused outrage among many of the
almost  11,000 retired foreign service officers, who traditionally
have  had total access.
in  testimony to the senate foreign relations committee last
week,  secretary of state madeleine albright, who ordered the
crackdown  under congressional pressure, said:
''i  am trying here to find a middle ground in terms of not
having  with hunts or being lax. we cannot have a culture of laxity
as  far as security issues are concerned.''

[HEADLINE] :  boy dies in mideast clash
[TEXT]
netzarim,  gaza strip (ap) -- caught in israeli-palestinian cross
fire,  a father and son clung together behind a metal barrel, barely
visible  in the smoke, as shots flew overhead. ''the child, the
child!''  the father yelled, helplessly waving his arm in the air.
the  boy screamed in panic as shots hit a wall just inches over
their  heads. seconds later, 12-year-old mohammed aldura was fatally
struck  in the abdomen. he loosened his grip on his father and
slumped  over.
seriously  wounded, the father, jamal, shook with convulsions,
rolled  his eyes skyward and lost consciousness. he was hospitalized
in  gaza and was expected to recover, family members said saturday.
an  ambulance driver was killed trying to rescue them, and a
palestinian  police officer also died in the clash.
the  three killed in netzarim were among 12 palestinians who died
saturday,  in the bloodiest clashes on the west bank and gaza strip
since  1996. more than 500 palestinians were injured, the
palestinian  health minister said. on friday, six were killed and
more  than 200 injured, authorities said.
the  fighting followed a hardline israeli opposition leader's
thursday  visit to a disputed jerusalem shrine, sacred to both jews
and  muslims.
saturday's  victims included three palestinians killed in the
west  bank town of ramallah, and six who died in the west bank town
of  nablus, including two policemen and a teen-ager.
khaled  bazyan, 16, left home saturday morning to join a
rock-throwing  protest against israeli soldiers. his mother, alia,
feared  the worst. she sent her younger son mohammed to bring him
back,  but khaled wouldn't listen.
the  boy, who dropped out of high school last week to take a job
at  a car wash, was killed when israeli soldiers crouching behind
jeeps  traded fire with masked palestinian gunmen in an olive grove
south  of nablus.
his  mother kissed khaled goodbye when his body was brought to
her  home before burial, lying on a stretcher and wrapped in a
palestinian  flag.
''last  night he was playing soccer in the room with his brother
and  i warned him not to break the furniture. he wouldn't stop and
was  happy,'' she said, dressed in black and breaking into tears.
khaled  was only a toddler when his teen-age neighbors were dying
in  the intefadeh, the 1987-1993 palestinian uprising against
israeli  military occupation.
although  an israeli-palestinian peace treaty remains elusive,
khaled's  parents never imagined their oldest son would become
another  victim in the conflict.
''when  the israeli army withdrew from nablus we felt safe,'' the
father,  adli said. ''but today we felt that the occupation is still
here  in our land.''

[HEADLINE] :  olympic tv ratings drop to new low
[TEXT]
new  york (ap) -- fewer and fewer people are tuning in to nbc's
sydney  olympics coverage, with the 15th night of taped telecasts
drawing  the lowest rating yet by a large margin.
friday  night's program, which included marion jones competing in
the  long jump and the u.s. basketball team's two-point semifinal
victory  over lithuania, pulled in a 10.6 rating and 20 share
measured  from 7:30 p.m. to midnight.
that's  15 percent lower than the previous worst nightly rating
for  these olympics (tuesday's 12.4), 35 percent lower than what
advertisers  were told to expect (16.1), and 40-43 percent lower
than  nbc sports predicted its programs would get (17.5 to 18.5).
no  night at any of the last three summer games rated worse than
the  12.3 for the closing ceremonies at seoul 12 years ago.
nbc  has increased the number of national commercials it runs by
an  average of two per hour to satisfy advertisers expecting to
reach  larger audiences during the 17 days in sydney. sponsors paid
up  to $600,000 for a 30-second commercial in prime time.
with  two nights left to measure, the cumulative rating for the
olympics  slipped to a new low of 14.2 with a 25 share.
that's  worse than for any summer olympics since the tokyo games
in  1964, when nbc aired only 14 hours and averaged a 12.7 rating.
each  rating point represents a little more than 1 million
television  households. share is the percentage of in-use tvs tuned
to  a given program.
friday  night's show had a 10.8 rating from 8-11 p.m., peaking
with  a 12.7 from 10:30-11.
nbc  decided to show all action on tape because sydney is 15
hours  ahead of the east coast, and one factor probably hurting the
ratings  is the delay between when events are completed and when
they  are aired. results are available on the internet and on tv
sportscasts  up to 24 hours before nbc shows the competition.
the  olympics also have to compete with the nfl, college football
and  baseball's pennant races.
other  networks, though, have little incentive to try to
audiences  away from the olympics, because nielsen media research
pushed  back the official starting date of the new tv season two
weeks  to oct. 2.

[HEADLINE] :  lazio raises $10.7 million in five weeks, spends almost $15 million
[TEXT]
clinton,  n.y. (ap) - rep. rick lazio said saturday that his
campaign  had raised a whopping $10.7 million over the last five
weeks  for his senate race against hillary rodham clinton, but also
spent  almost $15 million during that same period.
word  of lazio's fund-raising success and heavy spending came
after  he finished marching in a parade in this historic village
near  utica.
clinton  aides reported much more disappointing figures for the
first  lady, saying she had raised $2.6 million during the period
and  was left with $2.5 million on hand.
the  new york senate race is expected to be the most expensive in
u.s.  history.
lazio,  at a later campaign stop at a syracuse shopping mall,
said  the heavy spending was because of television advertising
needed  to ''cut through a message and have some parity.''
clinton  has also been spending heavily on television in recent
weeks.  much of her tv advertising has been financed by democratic
groups  and paid for through unlimited soft-money donations. an
agreement  by lazio and clinton reached last weekend has banned such
soft-money  spending on tv ads for the remainder of the campaign.
''this  filing shows that rick lazio's 11th-hour acceptance of
hillary's  soft money proposal was nothing more than a strategic
ploy,''  said karen finney, a campaign spokeswoman, adding that
lazio  only accepted the soft money ban because, ''he has a hard
money  advantage.''
the  figures reported saturday are made up of donations limited
to  $1,000 for an individual. despite finney's comment, it was lazio
who  seemed to push hardest for the soft money ban.
lazio  said his success in raising money from late august through
the  end of september ''demonstrates a lot of grassroots support; it
demonstrates  enthusiasm.''
as  of late august, lazio reported having $10.2 million on hand
while  clinton said she had $7.1 million. lazio aides said saturday
that  as of the end of september, the congressman had $6.1 million
still  in the bank.
recent  polls have shown clinton edging ahead of lazio in the
senate  race.
the  figures come from reports prepared for filing with the
federal  election commission.
lazio  stumped saturday in some of the same locales hit earlier
in  the campaign by clinton, who has attracted generally larger
crowds  at her stops.
''i  think it's great to be in this new york clinton,'' lazio
said  as he prepared to march in the village of clinton's annual
homecoming  parade. ''and, to have all these clintonians' support
lazio  is really a great boost for our campaign.''
in  fact, scattered along the mile-long parade route were a few
''we  love hillary'' signs. they were far outnumbered by the
''clinton  for lazio'' signs.
in  a demonstration of political gamesmanship, more than a dozen
placard-waving  clinton supporters showed up at the end of the
parade  route to cheer for the first lady as lazio climbed back
aboard  his ''mainstream express'' campaign bus.
on  clinton's main square, lazio shook hands with many of the
several  hundred people on hand. at most, the crowd was one or two
deep,  a marked contrast to the first lady's lunch-stop visit
earlier  this year when the crowd on the village green was often a
half-dozen  deep.
earlier  in the day, after a stop at a marina in frankfort, lazio
was  greeted by a crowd of about 150 people in little falls.
''i'll  take this enthusiasm and this crowd any day,'' the long
island  republican said as he campaigned in the small herkimer
county  village on the banks of the mohawk river. ''i'm very happy
with  the crowds.''
in  little falls, lazio delivered a 14-minute version of his
stump  speech, touching on everything from his support for an
amendment  to ban flag burning to republican attempts to repeal
federal  inheritance taxes.
as  a freight train rumbled, lazio paused.
''must  be the clintons heading back to arkansas,'' lazio said to
the  crowd's laughter. ''i knew it was going to happen after
election  day, but i didn't think it would be this soon.''
on  hand for lazio's little falls appearance was katie nichols,
who  heads up the herkimer county democratic party effort for
clinton's  campaign.
''there  was a lot larger crowd when hillary was here,'' nichols
commented.
 during  a lunch stop at a symeon's, a greek restaurant near
utica,  lazio said he felt much more comfortable on the campaign
trail  than he did when he first started out in mid-may. but he also
said  that he sometimes wakes up during overnights on the road and
can't  get back to sleep.
''i  immediately start thinking of things i have to do,'' he
said.
 lazio  later stopped at a shopping mall in the buffalo suburbs.
clinton  took the day off from the campaign trail. she finished
up  a three-day, fund-raising trip to oklahoma, las vegas and
california  on friday.

[TEXT]
havana  (ap) -- iranian president mohammad khatami met saturday
with  cuban leader fidel castro during an official visit to the
island  following the opec summit in nearby venezuela.
the  subjects of the talks were not disclosed. cuba's state media
earlier  indicated that the leaders would talk about a variety of
trade  issues, and discuss establishment of a direct maritime link
between  their countries. the two countries conduct around $100
million  in trade a year, mostly in sugar and agriculture
oil,  a leading economic and domestic issue for communist cuba,
might  also have been discussed. cuba was dependent on its socialist
allies  for most of its oil before the soviet union broke up a
decade  ago.
in  recent years, cuba has increased its production of oil and
gas  for domestic consumption but remains dependent on fuel imports.
just  before the talks, the two men greeted one another before
local  and international media: castro in his typical olive military
drabs;  khatami, in the flowing robe and black turban that signifies
his  descent from islam's 7th century prophet muhammad.
castro  invited khatami to visit cuba when they first met at the
summit  of non-aligned countries in south africa in 1998.
khatami  was a central figure at the summit of the organization
of  petroleum exporting countries that wrapped up thursday in
caracas.  after the opec summit ended, khatami and iraqi vice
president  taha yassin ramadan discussed upgrading diplomatic
relations  between their countries that have been frayed since their
1980-88  war.

bloodiest  clashes in the west bank and gaza strip since 1996. more than 500
palestinians  were injured, the palestinian health minister said. among those
killed  was a 12-year-old boy who was caught in the cross fire. cowering behind
his  father, he screamed in panic as shots hit a wall just inches above their
heads.  seconds later, the boy was fatally shot in the abdomen.
bush,  gore prepare for first debate
austin,  texas (ap) -- al gore and george w. bush dug into intense
preparations  today for the first presidential debate, honing styles and
strategies  for trumping the other guy in confrontations five weeks before the
election.  for democrat gore, the road to boston on tuesday led through sarasota,
fla.  republican bush's path led through his ranch in crawford, texas. for both
men,  the event is an opportunity to introduce themselves to americans only now
tuning  in what could be the closest election since 1960. issues ranging from
abortion,  oil prices, health care, social security and education to voting
records  and reputations provide fodder for attacks on such matters as gore's
penchant  for exaggeration and bush's ability to lead.
christian  coalition gets bush video
washington  (ap) -- george w. bush reaffirmed his support for the christian
coalition's  values today in a three-minute videotaped address meant to soothe
any  hard feelings created by his absence from their convention. ''should i be
elected,  i will lead our nation toward a culture that values life, the life of
the  elderly and the sick, the life of the young and the life of the unborn,''
bush  said. he didn't explain why he initially hadn't intended to speak.
priest  takes ax to ill. abortion clinic
rockford,  ill. (ap) -- a catholic priest smashed his car into an abortion
clinic  this morning, then chopped at the building with an ax until the owner
fired  two shotgun blasts to stop him, police said. the clinic was not open and
nobody  was injured in the attack, which came just two days after federal
approval  of the abortion pill ru-486. the rev. john earl, 32, was arrested and
charged  with burglary and felony criminal damage to property, police said.
abortion  providers say they are usually are on alert for violence following
abortion-related  events in the news.
va.  judge says inmates can get dna test
alexandria,  va. (ap) -- inmates who claim they were wrongfully convicted have
a  constitutional right to request dna testing that might prove their innocence,
a  federal judge ruled. u.s. district judge albert v. bryan jr. issued the ruling
friday  in the case of james harvey, 59, who was convicted of rape in 1990. bryan
did  not order dna testing for harvey but said the 14th amendment allows state
prisoners  to file federal civil rights lawsuits seeking dna testing. although a
district  judge's decision is not binding on other courts, harvey's lawsuit could
become  a national test case.
peru  hit by another scandal
lima,  peru (ap) -- the scandal stunned peruvians, sent ripples through the
international  community and may have contributed to president alberto fujimori's
decision  to break from his powerful spy chief, but it had nothing to do with a
videotape  apparently showing intelligence head vladimiro montesinos bribing an
opposition  lawmaker. this was peru's other scandal: a clandestine pipeline
smuggling  arms to colombian guerrillas. colombia has cast doubt on peru's
explanation  that the smuggling was committed by rogue former military officers
--  and many here suspect peru's military was behind the arms sales.
indians  beat blue jays 6-5
cleveland  (ap) -- chuck finley got his sixth win in september and roberto
alomar  hit a disputed homer as the cleveland indians put the pressure on seattle
and  oakland in the al wild card race, holding on for a 6-5 victory today over
the  toronto blue jays. manny ramirez also homered as the indians moved within a
half-game  of the mariners for the wild card, and pulled one game behind the
athletics,  who lead the al west.

[HEADLINE] :  tropical storm keith strengthens
[TEXT]
mexico  city (ap) -- tropical storm keith strengthened to a
hurricane  saturday and threatened to hit mexico's yucatan
peninsula.
 heavy  rain pounded the eastern yucatan, belize and northern
honduras  on saturday. storm surges caused rivers to overflow and
flooded  thousands of homes, civil protection officials in mexico
said.
 a  hurricane warning remained in effect along the yucatan
peninsula's  eastern shore, from cabo catoche south to monkey river
town  in belize, according to the national hurricane center in
miami.
 at  4 p.m. edt, keith was centered about about 105 miles
east-southeast  of chetumal, mexico. maximum sustained winds
increased  to 100 mph, and forecasters expected the storm to drift
north-northwest  sunday.
a  tropical storm becomes a hurricane when winds reach 74 mph.
meanwhile,  tropical storm joyce headed for the windward islands,
raising  storm warnings for trinidad, tobago and grenada. a tropical
storm  watch was in effect for barbados, st. lucia, st. vincent and
the  grenadines.
hurricane  isaac diminished saturday, with sustained winds at
about  75 mph. the storm was in open water, about 1,120 miles west
of  the westernmost azores.

[HEADLINE] :  fbi opens probe of bush debate tape
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- the fbi has expanded its investigation to
determine  if superiors of an employee of george w. bush's media
consultant  were involved in sending a bush debate tape to his
democratic  opponent, a federal law enforcement official said
saturday.
 bush  expressed confidence that none of his supporters were
involved  and the media consultant, mark mckinnon, helped him
prepare  on saturday for debate at his ranch outside crawford,
texas.
 ''i'm  confident that nobody who supports my candidacy would have
mailed  the tape,'' bush told reporters. ''i look forward to finding
out  who it is.''
asked  if he would fire anyone if a theft were discovered, he
said,  ''if i found somebody stealing from our campaign? yeah, i
sure  would.''
mckinnon,  interviewed by phone while driving back to austin with
chief  bush strategist karl rove, said he didn't believe his
employee,  yvette lozano, had anything to do with mailing the debate
tape  to an al gore confidant. ''i'm just anxious to get this
resolved,''  mckinnon said.
rove  and several bush advisers said they have confidence in
mckinnon,  and there are no signs of finger-pointing between
advisers.  the campaign has also defended lozano, the initial focus
of  the fbi investigation.
the  fbi questioned rove on saturday for about 30 minutes at bush
campaign  headquarters in austin, said dan bartlett, a bush
spokesman.  he called the questions routine, involving rove's access
to  debate material and about the material itself. rove is one of
the  last senior bush officials to be interviewed by federal agents.
a  federal law enforcement official, speaking on condition of
anonymity,  said saturday that the bureau has opened a full criminal
investigation  in the matter. previously the bureau was conducting a
preliminary  inquiry and officials had thought it could take some
time.
 opening  a full criminal investigation means agents and
prosecutors  are more confident of the evidence they have in hand,
and  are more confident that some federal statute has been violated
and  are closer to resolution.
lozano,  who works for mckinnon at maverick media, has denied
mailing  the debate materials. she and mckinnon have said the
package  she mailed sept. 11 from austin contained gap pants she was
returning  to the company.
the  fbi was comparing fingerprints of lozano with those found on
the  inside and outside of the debate package mailed from austin to
washington,  the federal law enforcement official said. she has said
the  fbi took a second set of fingerprints and seized her computer.
one  federal investigator cautioned that fingerprints found on
the  package would not necessarily be conclusive because lozano may
have  touched the items in the normal course of business at the ad
office.
 the  label on the express mail package received by gore adviser
tom  downey on sept. 13 corresponds to the date lozano was filmed by
a  security camera mailing a package, the official said. downey
turned  the package over to the fbi after finding the bush debate
materials.
 lozano  was initially linked to the case through forensic work by
the  fbi laboratory, officials said.
fbi  and justice department officials tentatively have settled on
three  possible federal crimes to investigate: theft from a
federally  funded activity, mail fraud and false statements to fbi
agents.
 campaign  officials were surprised by news of the expanded fbi
probe.
 karen  hughes, bush's director of communications, said the fbi
has  not contacted the campaign since last week when fbi director
louis  freeh spoke with campaign manager joe allbaugh and assured
him  the agency was taking the investigation seriously. she
questioned  why details of the probe were leaked.
''i  hope that someone in washington is not playing politics with
the  investigation,'' hughes said.
bush  aides say they suspect the material was illegally obtained
by  a junior staff member or -- more likely, they say -- by somebody
who  gained access to mckinnon's firm through an editing company in
the  same building. a security lapse may have given somebody the
opportunity  to copy the material illegally, aides say.
privately,  bush aides say they don't think the fbi is pursuing
all  avenues, particularly the editing firm that does business with
democrats  as well as republicans.
the  developments were an unneeded distraction for the bush
campaign  as the first debate loomed tuesday night.
mckinnon  told the austin american-statesman that questions to
him  indicated the fbi was looking into the possibility that bush
campaign  officials had the package mailed as part of a scheme to
have  the upcoming debates postponed or canceled.
hughes  said any suggestion that the bush campaign would send the
tape  to gore to throw doubt on the debates' credibility ''is
absolutely  absurd.''
gore  said saturday, ''i have full confidence in the fbi.''
the  fbi and attorneys from the public integrity section of the
justice  department's criminal division are trying to decide whether
the  case amounts to a violation of federal law. to be a federal
crime  a theft from a federally supported activity must be valued at
more  than $5,000.

[HEADLINE] :  sen. strom thurmond hospitalized
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- sen. strom thurmond collapsed saturday at a
restaurant  in suburban alexandria, va., and has been hospitalized.
the  97-year-old south carolina republican, the oldest person
ever  to serve in the senate, was first taken to inova alexandria
hospital,  and later transported to walter reed army medical center,
inova  spokeswoman rita wakefield said.
thurmond  was in fair condition, wakefield said.
the  nature of his problem was not immediately disclosed, but
thurmond  has been hospitalized several times in recent years for
various  problems, including fatigue, and had prostate surgery in
1999.
 an  alexandria fire department spokeswoman, sandy flynn, said
thurmond  was taken by ambulance from a downtown restaurant to the
hospital  at 1:40 p.m. edt.
a  washington television station reported that thurmond was
stricken  while dining with two friends. during the meal, the
senator  had a glazed look, then lowered his head to the table and
said  he needed to sleep, wrc-tv said.
christopher  swift, manager at the southside 815 restaurant, said
thurmond  and the other men came in for lunch. ''he really looked
tired,''  swift said. ''basically as a precautionary measure, the
two  gentlemen with him asked us to call an ambulance.''
the  ambulance responded to a 911 call.
thurmond  aides did not immediately return telephone calls
saturday.
 in  may, thurmond was released from walter reed after a three-day
stay  for what an aide said was a back problem.
earlier  that month, he was twice hospitalized for an upset
stomach  and fatigue.
thurmond,  the longest-serving senator and oldest member of
congress,  was first elected to the senate in 1954. when he was
re-elected  to his eighth senate term in november 1996, thurmond
said  it would be his last campaign.
he  was always proud of his health, even into his upper 90s. but
starting  in 1999, a succession of hospital visits called that into
question.

[HEADLINE] :  life after 'big brother' begins
[TEXT]
los  angeles (ap) -- is there life after ''big brother?''
that's  the question facing contestants who spent weeks away from
civilization  as houseguests of the cbs reality show.
from  marriage proposals to job searches, the contestants now
will  find out what life on the outside has in store for them. if
the  experiences of the castaways from the network's more successful
reality  show ''survivor'' are any guide, the houseguests will have
to  deal with some newfound fame.
the  88-day endurance test ended friday with eddie mcgee, the
blunt  new yorker who lost his left leg to cancer, winning the top
prize  of a half million dollars. the only plans mcgee admitted to
was  ''having a real great holiday season.''
mcgee  outlasted nine other contestants who entered the specially
built  house july 5 where their every move was followed by cameras
and  microphones, with the frequently dull results airing as often
as  six nights a week on cbs.
californian  josh souza won $100,000 as the second-place
finisher,  and new york lawyer curtis kin won $50,000.
jamie,  a former seattle beauty contest winner and one of the
last  to leave the house, said she was amazed to learn how viewers
had  bonded with the group inside. since returning to the real world
just  days ago, she said, she has fielded a dozen marriage
proposals.
 like  many of the contestants, she wouldn't reveal her last name.
at  a celebration attended by all 10 contestants after the show
ended,  george, known for his outlandish costumes, came dressed as a
chicken,  his hair dyed orange and hoping to parlay his stint on the
show  into a job.
former  houseguests brittany and karen said they have remained
close  after being booted off the show and have both auditioned for
several  acting roles. there was no word saturday if they had landed
any  parts.
jordan,  who was once an exotic dancer, is writing a book on
feminism.
 the  castaways from ''survivor'' have signed book and film deals,
earned  tv acting parts and walked down the red carpet at the 52nd
annual  primetime emmy awards. some have even filmed commercials
promoting  cbs shows and co-hosted ''live with regis!''
but  ''big brother'' publicist diane ekeblad said the shows'
contestants  are very different from those on ''survivor,'' and
their  desires -- and the success of those desires -- ''varies from
person  to person.''
''it's  still a little early to tell,'' she said. ''now that the
show  is over, we will be learning more.''
along  with the glory, reality-based show contestants must also
be  able to handle the sometimes unflattering publicity as one
contestant  already learned.
ousted  ''big brother'' contestant karen fowler made news when
she  filed for legal separation from her husband, less than two
weeks  after viewers voted her off the program. she also said she
moved  to california because of negative comments about her in the
columbus,  ind., community and in the media.

[HEADLINE] :  clinton pushes school construction
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- president clinton, bemoaning what he said were
too  many overcrowded and crumbling schools, pledged saturday not to
budge  from budget talks until republicans set aside billions for
school  construction and his education priorities.
he  also released a department of education study showing that at
least  60 percent of schools in the country need repairs and that
the  work would cost an estimated $127 billion.
in  his weekly radio address, clinton took aim at the
gop-controlled  congress: ''every day they stall is another day our
children  are forced to go to school in trailers, overcrowded
classrooms  and crumbling buildings. it's hard for students to lift
themselves  up in schools that are falling down,'' the president
said.
 ''we're  not going to leave the (negotiating) table until we
invest  in modernizing our schools and continue our efforts to hire
100,000  quality teachers for smaller classes,'' clinton said.
the  president supports legislation sponsored by reps. charles
rangel,  d-n.y., and nancy johnson, r-conn., to subsidize $24.8
billion  in school construction bonds; the federal government would
provide  tax credits for the interest normally paid on a bond.
under  the proposal, 60 percent of the money would go to states
based  on school-age population, with the rest directed to the 125
school  districts with the largest number of low-income students.
the  estimated five-year cost is $1.74 billion.
the  bill has 228 co-sponsors, a majority.
clinton  also is seeking $1.3 billion in grants and interest-free
loans  to help schools make emergency repairs at 5,000 schools.
the  white house said that over five years that initiative would
help  25,000 schools repair roofs, heating and cooling systems, and
electrical  wiring.
some  republicans oppose any new program that mandates how
schools  spend federal money, and believe the plan would increase
the  federal bureaucracy and control over local schools.
rep.  bill archer, chairman of the tax-writing house ways and
means  committee, faulted clinton for a ''red-tape approach'' and
costs  would rise by 15 percent under a requirement to pay
prevailing  wage rates, as demanded by labor unions.
''it's  just wrong-headed to jack up the costs of school
construction  when dollars are limited and the needs are so great,''
said  archer, r-texas.
but  clinton said the need is urgent and widespread, and cited
several  examples:
--a  florida school where classes spill over to 12 trailers.
--a  new york school that holds 400 students over capacity.
--a  virginia school with such poor electrical service that the
circuit  breaker cuts off when a new computer is plugged into the
wall.
 in  alabama and wyoming, according to the education department,
more  than 80 percent of the schools are reported in need of
repairs.
 ''many  states and local communities are working to fix their
schools,  but too many school districts simply don't have the tax
base  to handle the burden alone,'' the president said.
the  new fiscal year begins sunday, although congress voted to
keep  government programs running through next friday.
school  construction is a central issue in negotiations between
the  white house and gop leaders on the remaining budget bills for
fiscal  2001 that must be passed before congress can adjourn.
''congress  still hasn't sent me a budget for education and other
pressing  priorities,'' clinton said. ''yet they have found the
time,  first, to pass huge, fiscally irresponsible tax cuts, and
then  after i vetoed them, to load up the spending bills with
hundreds  of millions of dollars in special-interest projects.''
''well,  it's time to turn off the pork barrel spigot and deliver
for  our children's future,'' he said.

[TEXT]
new  albany, ohio (ap) -- shani waugh has never finished better
than  fourth in 97 career lpga events. now she's 18 holes away from
her  first title.
the  australian shot a 6-under-par 66 saturday, matching her
lowest  competitive score ever, to lead defending champion annika
sorenstam  by a shot heading into the final round of the new albany
golf  classic.
waugh,  whose best finish this season is a tie for sixth at the
rail  classic, stands at 12-under 204.
the  only other time waugh was in the final group on the last day
of  a tournament, she turned in a 76 at the 1999 jamie farr toledo
classic.
 sorenstam  hit a 7-foot birdie putt on the closing hole to cap
her  second consecutive 68. she is seeking her sixth victory of the
season  in the last full-field tour event this year.
sorenstam  came into the day ahead by a shot, but was passed on
the  front side despite making the turn in 2 under.
brandie  burton went through the first nine in 6-under 30 to grab
the  lead at 11 under, then gave it away with two bad holes.
burton,  a captain's pick for next week's solheim cup, played the
last  four holes on the front side in 4 under, including an eagle at
the  par-5 sixth hole.
but  she found the water on her wedge approach to the par-5 13th,
then  missed a 15-footer for bogey. she then three-putted the next
hole  to fall three shots behind waugh, who broke free from a tie
for  the top spot with sorenstam by hitting a 9 iron to 4 feet for
birdie  at no. 13.
after  sorenstam hit to 10 feet below the hole on the 16th, waugh
stepped  up and nearly spun a sand wedge in. her 3-foot birdie putt
put  her ahead by two strokes. sorenstam cut that lead in half on
the  final hole.
burton  birdied the 18th for a 68 that left her tied for third at
9  under with beth daniel and scotland's catriona matthew.
kelli  kuehne, mi hyun kim, heather bowie, donna andrews and lori
kane  all were another two strokes back.

[HEADLINE] :  milosevic refuses mediation offer
[TEXT]
belgrade,  yugoslavia (ap) -- preparing to face down the
opposition  in the streets, president slobodan milosevic on saturday
turned  down an offer of russian mediation, a u.s. official said.
the  defiant balkan leader declared yugoslavs themselves ''will
decide  our fate.''
milosevic  spoke as the opposition unveiled plans for what they
hope  will be nationwide work stoppages and blockades to force the
yugoslav  president to accept defeat by challenger vojislav
kostunica  in the sept. 24 election.
the  opposition claims kostunica won outright, but the government
insists  he failed to take enough votes to avoid a runoff next
sunday.  the federal electoral commission on saturday formally
rejected  all opposition challenges of alleged vote irregularities.
that  has raised fears of violence as the only way out of the
yugoslav  impasse.
in  an effort to ease the situation, russian president vladimir
putin  offered on saturday to send his foreign minister, igor
ivanov,  to belgrade to try to defuse the showdown. however,
secretary  of state madeleine albright, however, said the russians
should  accept milosevic's apparent defeat.
the  only message moscow should send, she said, was that the
yugoslav  president is ''finished.''
president  clinton reinforced that point later saturday in a
half-hour  telephone conversation with putin. according to p.j.
crowley,  the spokesman for the national security council, ''both
leaders  agreed that it is important for milosevic to accept the
will  of the serbian people.''
according  to crowley, putin told clinton that his offer to send
ivanov  to meet both milosevic and kostunica had been rejected.
there  was no official statement from the government whether
milosevic  had rejected the russian offer. but at a speech saturday
to  the yugoslav military academy, milosevic said: ''we alone will
decide  our fate.''
thousands  of opposition supporters gathered in belgrade on
saturday  night to hear their leaders announce a general strike for
monday  and a limited road blockade sunday as a ''dress rehearsal.''
''no  more big words, speeches and rallies,'' said vuk obradovic,
a  former army general and now milosevic opponent. ''our message to
the  police, to the army and to paramilitary units is that we are
not  afraid of them.''
obradovic  suggested that if milosevic sends his forces to
attack,  crowds from elsewhere in the country would converge on the
capital.  ''not a single drop of blood must be shed,'' he added.
''we  ask everybody to be peaceful and dignified.''
opposition  leaders, using figures from their poll watchers,
claim  kostunica won the election with 51.34 percent to 36.22
percent  for milosevic. but the federal electoral commission, in a
tally  criticized by the united states and other countries, says
kostunica  fell short of the majority needed to avoid a runoff oct.
8.
 milosevic  still controls the army and the police, traditional
pillars  of his power. seeking to shore up those bases, the yugoslav
president  addressed graduation ceremony saturday at the yugoslav
military  academy and congratulated the newly commissioned officers
for  serving ''at a time of great temptation for our people and
state.''
 in  his first public appearance since last weekend's election,
milosevic  reminded the military of its duty to defend ''our freedom
and  the independence of our country,'' which the government claims
is  at risk because of alleged western interference in the yugoslav
election.
 ''foreign  forces will not dare attack us again, unless they try
to  come here with an invitation from our domestic enemies,''
milosevic  said, referring to the opposition. ''since foreign
military  intervention or a war are out of the question, other means
of  destruction of yugoslavia are being mentioned -- psychological,
media  and political pressures.''
in  moscow, putin offered to send foreign minister igor ivanov to
belgrade  to meet with both sides. russia -- among yugoslavia's
strongest  allies -- has warned the west to avoid meddling in the
election.
 ''if  belgrade finds it possible, russia would be prepared to
play  a higher profile in the process of settlement and coordination
of  positions,'' putin said, according to the kremlin press service.
albright,  however, insisted the russians must tell milosevic it
was  time to give up power and that she would convey that message to
ivanov  by telephone.
''i  think the russians need to make clear that they understand
that  this has been a procedure where the opposition has won,'' she
told  reporters in reykjavik, iceland. ''the russians need to
understand  that milosevic lost in this round. he is finished. it is
time  for him to go.''
opposition  leaders have called for a peaceful civil disobedience
campaign,  hoping to avoid provoking milosevic into using the army
and  police against them.
scattered  protests and road blockades took place saturday in
various  parts of serbia. various professional associations have
also  pledged to support the opposition. university and high school
students  have announced they will join the general strike.
truckers,  farmers and workers blocked several roads in different
parts  of serbia saturday, some for only several hours as a warning
of  a broader blockade on monday.
miners  at the kolubara coal mine, workers in pancevo oil
refinery,  railroad workers in the western serbia have also decided
to  go on strike until the authorities acknowledge the opposition
victory.
 the  opposition had filed several complaints of alleged
irregularities,  chief among them that milosevic supporters packed
ballot  boxes in kosovo with thousands of votes purportedly from
kosovo  albanians. the united nations, which administers the
province,  said virtually all kosovo albanians boycotted the ballot.

[TEXT]
tuscaloosa,  ala. (ap) -- milo lewis intercepted two
fourth-quarter  passes and backup quarterback andrew zow revived a
sputtering  offense as alabama beat no. 23 south carolina 27-17 on
saturday.
 the  crimson tide (2-3, 2-1 southeastern conference) avoided
their  first 1-4 start in 43 years and handed the gamecocks (4-1,
2-1)  their first loss of the season. alabama has won all 10
meetings  in the series.
zow,  who lost the starting job after two games, entered on
alabama's  third series and never left. he sealed the victory with a
tackle-breaking  8-yard touchdown run with 4:57 left.
that  play was set up when lewis stepped in front of phil petty's
pass  and returned it 15 yards. a personal foul gave alabama the
ball  at south carolina's 26.
two  plays later, zow scrambled 11 yards to the 3. he scored
after  a delay of game penalty pushed the tide back.
petty,  who didn't start because of a sprained ankle, twice
brought  the gamecocks back from 10-point deficits in the second
half.
 he  threw td passes of 19 and 28 yards to jermale kelly. the
28-yarder,  set up by sheldon brown's 36-yard interception return,
snapped  a string of six straight incompletions, including lewis'
first  pick. it brought south carolina to 20-17 with 10:20 left in
the  game.
alabama  went three-and-out on its next series, but four plays
and  a gamecocks personal foul penalty later, lewis came up with
another  interception.
tailback  ahmaad galloway had put the tide up 20-10 with a
62-yard  run with 29 seconds left in the third quarter.
he  had gained just 15 yards on his first nine carries.
the  gamecocks, who had given up only 10 second-half points in
their  first four games, allowed 17 to the tide.
zow  entered the game with a woeful 58.0 passing rating and
didn't  play at all in last week's loss to arkansas.
he  replaced tyler watts, who had completed his last five passes
after  opening with an interception. zow was 14-of-26 for 149 yards.
petty  was the third quarterback used by lou holtz. he came in
with  south carolina facing first-and-10 at the alabama 36. petty
hit  jermale kelly on a 15-yard pass and went to him again on a
19-yard  td strike.
the  drive was kept alive by antione smith's 19-yard run on a
fake  punt.
petty,  who didn't start because of a sprained ankle, took over
after  eric kimrey and dondrial pinkins had alternated.
alabama's  10-3 halftime lead was largely courtesy of missed
opportunities  by south carolina.
the  gamecocks opened the game with a 15-play drive, capped by
reid  bethea's 48-yard field goal. south carolina made it to the
alabama  18 but was stalled after losing 13 yards on a high snap.
the  gamecocks failed to cash in on three trips inside the tide
10,  with bethea missing attempts of 28 and 21 yards, and marcus
spencer  picking off kimrey's attempt.

[HEADLINE] :  tiznow wins $500k super derby
[TEXT]
bossier  city, la. (ap) -- tiznow, an import from california,
broke  the louisiana downs track and stakes record with an
impressive  victory saturday the $500,000 super derby.
tiznow,  called his jockey chris mccarron, ''the best 3-year-old
in  the country right now,'' posted a time of 1:59.84 in the 1&amp;frac14;-mile
race  while turning back a challenge from belmont stakes winner
commendable.
 commendable,  ridden by pat day, was second, beaten by six
lengths.  mass market finished third.
the  old track and stakes record of 2:00.1 was shared by gate
dancer  in 1984 and mecke in 1995.
despite  a bad start, tiznow went quickly to the lead followed by
commendable.  tiznow started pulling away at the mile mark and
quickly  widened his lead.
''when  i called on my horse, he just wasn't able to respond,''
day  said.
the  winner, posting his third victory in seven starts, paid
$3.60,  $2.20 and $2.10 as the heavy favorite. commendable returned
$2.80  and $2.10, and mass market paid $2.10 to show.
clever  brick was fourth, followed by chris's bad boy and white
star.
 ''tiznow  has such long strides,'' said mccarron, a three-time
winner  ofd the race. ''he is extremely deceptive,''
mccarron  did not go to his whip and said his only anxious moment
was  at the start when tiznow, owned by michael cooper and cecilia
straub-rubens,  hopped coming out of the gate.
''he  recovered quickly and was able to get his position,''
mccarron  said.
it  was another disappointing loss for commendable, but trainer
d.  wayne lukas didn't appear concerned. the colt has not won since
his  triumph june 10 in the belmont.
''i'd  like to see him keep improving,'' said lukas, who is
mulling  entering him in one of the breeder's cup races later this
fall.

[TEXT]
clemmons,  n.c. (ap) -- larry nelson closed in on his fourth
victory  in five starts, shooting a 7-under-par 63 saturday to take
a  two-shot lead at the vantage championship.
nelson,  the senior pga tour's leading money-winner with more
than  $2 million, broke a tour record with his 28th straight round
of  par or better.
three  others shared the previous record of 27 rounds.
nelson  has a two-round total of 11-under 129. gil morgan, the
1998  vantage champion, shot a 65 to get to 9 under.
nelson,  who began the second round one shot off the lead,
birdied  the third, fourth and sixth holes. nelson held on to the
lead  the rest of the round after a birdie on the difficult uphill
par-4  10th combined with a morgan bogey.
bruce  summerhays, who bogeyed his last two holes, tied nelson
briefly  at 8 under. but nelson strung together birdies on 14, 15
and  16 to take a two-shot lead.
nelson  had a chance to tie the tournament record of 62, but
missed  a 5-foot birdie putt at the 18th.
jim  dent and first-round co-leader isao aoki are tied at 8 under
heading  into sunday's final round. dent shot his second straight 66
and  earned $34,000 as he won the two-round georgia-pacific senior
series  tournament for players 60 or older.
dean  overturf, another first-round co-leader, shot a 68 and is a
7  under with tom wargo.
summerhays,  who shot a 68, and bruce fleisher (67) are five
shots  back. hale irwin (66) and gary mccord (66) are among five
players  at 5 under.

[HEADLINE] :  texas aclu files suit over drug bust
[TEXT]
austin,  texas (ap) -- two law enforcement agents and a district
attorney  are beings sued their roles in an arrest stemming from a
drug  bust that has prompted allegations of racial discrimination in
northwest  texas.
forty-three  people were arrested in the 1999 bust in tulia, all
but  three of them black.
the  federal lawsuit was filed by the texas american civil
liberties  union on behalf of yul bryant, who was arrested in july
1999  for allegedly selling cocaine. his case was dismissed after
district  attorney terry mceachern found out undercover agent thomas
coleman  was not certain he had bought cocaine from bryant.
the  lawsuit accuses mceachern, coleman and sheriff larry stewart
of  falsely arresting, imprisoning and prosecuting bryant, who is
black.
 ''these  unlawful actions were part of a deliberate plan, scheme
and  policy of targeting members of the african-american community
of  swisher county, texas and removing them from the area using the
legal  system,'' the lawsuit claims.
the  lawsuit alleges that stewart prepared a list of local
citizens  and others he considered ''undesirables'' before enacting
a  policy to strong-arm them out of swisher county. most of the
people  listed are black, the lawsuit claims, and mceachern was part
of  stewart's plan.
coleman  was put to work as an ''undercover agent'' to try and
help  stewart, the lawsuit alleges.
stewart  would not comment on the lawsuit. coleman did not
immediately  return telephone calls from the associated press.
mceachern,  who prosecuted many of the drug cases, said that he
doesn't  believe he did anything wrong and that he dismissed the
case  as soon as he found out coleman was not sure bryant had sold
him  the drugs.
about  40 residents of the community of 5,000 rallied friday at
the  capitol as will harrell, executive director of texas american
civil  liberties union, announced the lawsuit. bryant is seeking $2
million  in damages.
of  those arrested in the same drug bust as bryant, 17 have
pleaded  guilty and 11 have been convicted.
lawanda  smith said she pleaded guilty to one count of delivering
a  controlled substance because she was afraid of the sentence she
might  receive if she went to trial. she denies selling drugs to
coleman.
 ''i  have never met the guy,'' she said. ''not ever.''
sammy  barrow, a 48-year-old truck driver from tulia, was at the
rally  because his two brothers were arrested in the bust.
''i'm  beginning to wonder now who's on the second list. am i?''
barrow  asked. ''do we need to be getting out of town?''

[HEADLINE] :  students and community members rally to protest nader's exclusion from the debates
[TEXT]
new  york (ap) - students and community activists tried to drum
up  support for ralph nader by giving a clearer picture of the green
party's  presidential candidate during a rally saturday at
washington  square park.
speakers  at the midday event attended by about 450 people
included  local college students, activists and actress susan
sarandon.  they hailed nader, who is lagging in the polls behind al
gore  and george w. bush, while saying he deserved to be included in
the  presidential debates.
''a  vote for nader is a vote for possibility,'' said johanna
fernandez  - a graduate student at columbia university who spoke at
the  rally.
fernandez  said she wanted to counteract the concept that a vote
for  nader is actually a vote for bush, which she called a ''scare
tactic  employed by the gatekeepers of the democratic party.''
she  questioned whether republican and democrat policies are that
different.  she said that over the past eight years of the clinton
administration,  prison populations have soared while federal funds
that  provide abortions for low-income women were drastically cut -
making  the service unavailable for many women.
fernandez  was impressed by the energy of the crowd, saying the
atmosphere  was ''reflective of the new mood of young people'' who
don't  want to continue reproducing ''the rightward trajectory of
american  politics over the past 30 years,'' she said.
an  organizer said although nader will likely not be included in
the  debates, some networks may cover his direct responses to the
questions  asked.
those  present wanted to stress that ''there is a s0970-----

[HEADLINE] :  cloned cow on auction block
[TEXT]
washington  (ap) -- her chest is broad, her legs and back
straight,  and she has ''an excellent mammary system,'' her owner
says.  mandy may be one of a kind, but not for long.
an  exact copy of the champion holstein cow will be auctioned
this  week in what is believed to be the first time a farm animal
has  been cloned for commercial sale.
the  first calf clone or clones -- several now are growing in the
wombs  of surrogate cattle -- are expected to fetch $50,000 to
$100,000  at friday's auction at the world dairy expo in madison,
wis.,  the dairy industry's biggest trade show.
the  cloning is a project of infigen inc., an international
leader  in cloning technology. infigen, based in deforest, wis.,
owns  its own herd of cloned cattle, which are used to produce
genetically  engineered proteins for pharmaceuticals. until now, no
one  has tried to clone the animals for commercial use by farmers
and  breeders.
''the  reason it hasn't been done before is that the technology
hasn't  been there to do it,'' said kenneth olson, a specialist in
animal  genetics with the american farm bureau federation.
cattle  embryos have been cloned before, but no one has made an
exact  duplicate of an adult cow and put it up for sale, said
xiangzhong  yang, director of the transgenic animal facility at the
university  of connecticut.
''the  efficiency and cost is a major obstacle,'' he said.
research  in cloning animals for agricultural purposes has been slow
because  funds have gone toward pharmaceutical and medical uses of
the  animals, he said.
infigen's  process involves activating an unfertilized egg by
removing  the nucleus, fusing the egg with a cell from the same
animal's  ear, and then using a chemical compound to trigger a
release  of calcium that causes the egg to divide and grow; the
resulting  embryo is implanted in a surrogate cow.
the  vast majority of the embryos do not develop properly. so
far,  the company claims a success rate of no more than 5 percent
but  believes that is good enough to take it commercial.
given  that success rate, dairy industry experts say the process
still  costs too much to attract broad demand.
infigen  expects to charge about $25,000 per clone. but company
officials  believe breeders wanting to duplicate champion bulls and
cows  will show enough interest so the business can get off the
ground.
 as  the company continues to perfect its cloning process, the
price  will come down, said jesus martinez, infigen's director of
marketing.  infigen announced an agreement in august to provide
cloned  bulls to an ohio company that sells cattle genetics.
''right  now this is still an expensive way of doing business,
but  we've been able to replicate it enough that we'll be able to
take  it commercial,'' he said.
mandy,  age 8, is a senior citizen by cattle standards. but she
has  won major awards in the united states and canada since she was
a  calf. her owner, ron bader of orangeville, ill., paid $100,000
for  her when she was 2.
while  she can produce about 3,300 gallons of milk a year, about
twice  the national average for a cow, her main value is as a
breeder.  she regularly is mated with prize bulls, and the
fertilized  embryos are removed and placed in surrogate cows for
additional  breeding. the calves sell for $15,000 to $25,000.
''she's  a very, very consistent performer,'' bader said,
referring  to mandy's long list of awards. ''that's the kind of
genetics  you want in your herd.''
bader  said he was skeptical of cloning when he was approached by
infigen  about making a mandy copy, but decided to go ahead after
visiting  the company's herd. ''you get an exact duplicate. that was
what  impressed me.''

[HEADLINE] :  adirondacks look to weed out plant invaders
[TEXT]
	  ray brook, n.y. (ap) - along the highway, a stand of purple
loosestrife  might look appealing but it's a tough and unwanted
customer  that threatens native species and nature's balance.
in  the 6-million acre adirondack park, state and private groups
are  banding together to make sure invading plants don't get a
toehold  in the mountain range and start to push out plants vital to
the  local ecosystem.
''invasive  plants form a stand of one species that out-competes
other  types of plants,'' said nina schoch, program coordinator for
the  adirondack nature conservancy, one of the groups battling the
invaders.  ''it doesn't provide a diversity of habitat that a
variety  of animals needs to survive.''
in  a survey in 1998 and 1999, the nature conservancy found few
unwanted  plants in remote areas but discovered pockets of 10
species  including garlic mustard, purple loosestrife, common reed
grass  and japanese knotweed near roadways.
the  spread is not rampant and those concerned with the
wilderness  area want to keep it that way.
controlling  the plants will start along roadsides where they
have  begun to take hold. the state department of transportation
will  use straw instead of mulch on projects, reducing the chance of
''hitchhiker''  seeds that often come in the mulch.
dot  workers also are looking at ways to manually destroy the
nonnative  species, including burying them under a geotextile fabric
or  pulling them up by hand.
the  groups are getting assistance from other state agencies like
the  department of environmental conservation and from residents who
can  adopt a roadside and remove the plants.

alexandria,  va., his spokeswoman said.
doctors  at walter reed army medical center have not determined
why  he collapsed, but ''more than likely his condition can be
attributed  to dehydration,'' spokeswoman genevieve erny said.
thurmond,  r-s.c., will remain hospitalized through sunday for
observation,  but ''he appears to be doing very well,'' erny said.
thurmond  has been hospitalized several times in recent years for
various  problems, including fatigue, and had prostate surgery in
1999.  erny said the collapse was unrelated to previous illnesses.
alexandria  fire department spokeswoman sandy flynn said thurmond
was  taken by ambulance from a downtown restaurant to inova
alexandria  hospital at 1:40 p.m. edt. he was later transported to
walter  reed in washington.
thurmond  was lunching with a staffer and an acquaintance when he
began  to feel tired and fainted, erny said. ''he did momentarily
lose  consciousness for a second or two,'' she said.
''he  really looked tired,'' said christopher swift, manager of
the  southside 815 restaurant. ''basically as a precautionary
measure,  the two gentlemen with him asked us to call an
ambulance.''
 the  ambulance responded to a 911 call.
in  may, thurmond was released from walter reed after a three-day
stay  for what an aide said was a back problem.
earlier  that month, he was twice hospitalized for an upset
stomach  and fatigue.
thurmond,  the longest-serving senator and oldest member of
congress,  was first elected to the senate in 1954. when he was
re-elected  to his eighth senate term in november 1996, thurmond
said  it would be his last campaign. his term expires in january
2003.
 he  has always been proud of his health, even into his upper 90s.
but  starting in 1999, a succession of hospital visits called that
into  question.

[HEADLINE] :  report: many new york children in federal insurance program ineligible
[TEXT]
	  new york (ap) - up to half of the roughly 538,000 new york
children  enrolled in a federal health care plan are ineligible and
will  be removed from the plan over the next several months, the new
york  times reported saturday.
some  families began receiving notices several weeks ago that
their  children would be removed from the children's health
insurance  program as early as sunday and that they must apply for
medicaid,  the newspaper said.
health  insurance executives and advocates for the poor told the
times  that thousands of new york children were wrongly placed in
the  program largely because participating insurance plans did not
steer  families into medicaid even when it was clear they belonged
there.
 insurance  executives said the state health department did not
instruct  them to screen applicants for medicaid eligibility.
''the  department of health knew exactly what we were doing,''
said  michael a. stocker, president and chief executive of empire
blue  cross and blue shield, which insures 96,000 state children
enrolled  in the program. ''there is no secret about this. and there
is  no question that it is going to create problems.''
john  signor, a spokesman for the state health department, said
the  problems arose because time was needed to iron out the program.
''obviously  our top priority is to get children the health
insurance  they need and deserve,'' signor said. ''the federal
government  is now forcing states to move children who are eligible
for  medicaid into that program.'' he estimated that about 22
percent  of the children would have to be moved, but insurers and
others  put the figure closer to 50 percent.
signor  disputed stocker's numbers, saying the insurance company
has  a vested interest in keeping children off medicaid rolls
because  the insurance company is not reimbursed for medicaid
clients.  he also pointed out the health department's $10 million
investment  in facilitators at 34 locations that will help children
enroll  in the proper insurance plan.
state  comptroller carl mccall warned the health department
several  times over the last few years that it was enrolling too
many  children who belonged in medicaid, the newspaper said. the
department  responded to a 1998 audit by assuring mccall's office
that  it was requiring insurance carriers to screen applicants.
the  program was intended to insure children from low-income
families  whose incomes are too high for medicaid but too low to
afford  private insurance.
new  york, where the program is known as child health plus, is
one  of 10 states that have established a significant program so
far.  new york's enrolled children comprise roughly one quarter of
all  children in the program nationwide.
the  federal insurance program was approved by congress in 1997
and  is reimbursed by the federal government at a higher rate than
medicaid.  new york gets a 65 percent reimbursement, compared with
50  percent for medicaid.
the  federal government is examining whether new york state may
owe  it money, the times said.

''harrison's  flowers,'' a movie about the bosnian war.
